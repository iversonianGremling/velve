# PLAN — Surface-consistency refactor (v0.6)

Ordered execution plan derived from `TODO.md` and the design decisions taken in
review. Goal: fix the surface-syntax inconsistencies (the "mental-model breakers")
*before the surface freezes*, behind the editions system so existing code keeps
working. Each breaking step ships with a codemod and a green corpus run before the
next begins.

**Decision log (locked):** `Outcome` rename · `for…in` + kill `%` · delete ternary →
`if/then/else` · glue `?` / `?:` · `#{}` records · `:`/`=` honesty rewrite ·
editions-first · multi-clause exhaustiveness · trait naming · spread last-wins +
explicit-dup error · delete `pipe` block · keep `let` / `Char` · delete `saga` ·
prop-only `Responsive` collapse · static cycle pre-flag · close effects
unchecked-mode hole · §6 "what's built" table + SPEC drift sweep.
**Dropped:** `user? a | b` postfix eliminator (use `match` / `is Ok` / `?:`).

Codemod templates already exist: `checker/scripts/parens_codemod.mjs`,
`checker/scripts/corpus_codemod.mjs`.

## Track A — Surface consistency (the breaking refactor, edition-gated)

### Phase 0 — Editions scaffolding  ✅ DONE (2026-06)
SPEC §17. Nothing breaking lands until this exists.
- [x] Edition pragma `@edition "YYYY.M"` in the grammar (`program` → `edition_pragma`);
      parser regenerated + native binding rebuilt.
- [x] Edition resolver (`checker/src/edition.ts`): dated editions `2026.1` (baseline)
      / `2026.6`, `DEFAULT_EDITION`, `parseEdition`, `atLeast` gate helper.
- [x] `Module.edition` field; lowerer reads the pragma (strips it from decls),
      rejects unknown editions as a checker error, falls back to default.
- [x] Default absent→`2026.1` so the existing corpus compiles untouched (flips to
      latest once migrated). Superset grammar, edition-gated *semantics* (per SPEC §17).
- [x] **Deliverable shipped:** no-op gate. `edition_test.velve` (clean) +
      `edition_bad.velve` (unknown-edition error) added; original 83 fixtures
      byte-identical baseline (zero regression). SPEC §17 updated to as-built.
      Edition-gating of Phase 2/3 breaks rides `2026.6`.

### Phase 1 — Non-breaking foundations (land in current edition)  ✅ FOUNDATIONS DONE
No migration needed; additive checks (fix any fixtures they legitimately surface).
Enforcement value delivered (1b shipped, 1d/1e resolved). 1c + 1a deferred as
**edition-gated focused builds** (non-blocking — neither breaks any edition).
- [x] **1b. Close the effects unchecked-mode hole** (§3.6). ✅ DONE. A pure function
      calling an effectful one is now a violation — **warning in baseline `2026.1`,
      error in `2026.6`** (SPEC §17 deprecation lifecycle). First real use of the
      edition gate: `Ctx.edition` threaded from `Module.edition`; `atLeast(ed,
      "2026.6")` picks warning vs error (`infer.ts`). Blast radius = 1 fixture
      (`effects_test.velve` gains the documented warning); zero new errors corpus-wide.
      Declared-effect fns were already checked — this only closes the escape hatch.
- [x] **1e. Spread-conflict rule** (§5). ✅ RESOLVED (no code change). The
      *enforcement rule* already exists: `callresolve.ts:38` reports `argument '<name>'
      supplied twice` for any explicit duplicate (named/named **and** positional/named
      collision), verified live (`f(name="a", name="b")` → error). **There is no
      call-arg spread in the grammar** — `_arg_list` is `commaSep1(choice(named_arg,
      _expr))`; the only spreads are `record_spread` (`#{...base, …}`) and the UI `prop`
      spread. So `f(...rec, name=val)` doesn't parse → the last-wins half is a
      *feature-add*, not a rule. **Reclassified to Track B** (call-arg spread support).
- [x] **1d. Trait/constraint naming** (§5). ✅ DONE (SPEC honesty fix). Premise was
      wrong: there are **no compiler-known constraint sets** to name. `where a: X`
      parses but is a **no-op** — even a fabricated constraint name checks clean
      (verified). Comparison/equality type as `(a, a) -> Bool` for any matching `a` (no
      orderability check); `toString`/interpolation are `∀a. a -> String`. Velve has no
      typeclass system. SPEC §3.4 now carries a ⚠ "not yet enforced" block stating the
      real built-in signatures; a constraint solver is a deferred build.
- [x] **1c. Multi-clause head exhaustiveness** (§5). ✅ DONE, edition-gated.
      **Key simplification vs the original plan:** no `TypeRef→Type` resolution needed —
      for the safe subset the dispatch ADT is recovered *from the head constructor names*
      (`adtForCtors`), and only when they belong to **exactly one** known ADT (shared
      ctors like `Ok`/`Error`, in both `Result` and `TxResult`, are ambiguous → skipped).
      `checkClauseHeads` in `exhaust.ts` walks each multi-clause `DFn`, and per parameter
      position made entirely of `PCtor`s + optional catch-all binders, checks the closed
      ADT is fully covered. **Soundness:** a missing ctor at any position (no catch-all
      there) is *always* a genuine gap independent of other positions, so per-position
      checking yields **zero false positives** — it only under-reports correlated
      multi-axis dispatch (safe). Atom/literal/record dispatch is out of subset (skipped),
      sidestepping the atom-union modeling the plan feared. Warning 2026.1 / error 2026.6.
      New fixtures: `clause_heads_test.velve` (exhaustive + catch-all, green) and
      `clause_heads_bad.velve` (missing `Low`, 1 intended error). **Verified:** zero
      corpus false positives (no green fixture trips it; `fib`/`yesno`/`describe` are
      literal/atom dispatch → skipped); corpus 32→33 (the +1 is the new intended-error
      fixture only). SPEC §3.4 documents the rule; §0.5 table updated.
- [ ] **1a. Static convergence cycle pre-flag** (§3.1). ⚠ Lowest ROI / own pass. The
      runtime `converge.ts` check already catches literal cycles (just later, as a
      `RuntimeError` — verified `styles-design.md §6.6`). A static AST pass would only
      move the error earlier for the *literal* case; dynamic-list cycles stay runtime.
      Defer until 1c/1e land.

### Phase 1.5 — Prerequisite bug fix (non-breaking, baseline edition)  ✅ DONE
- [x] **Reserved keywords as field names.** `field_access`/`optional_chain` used
      `$.lower_id` for the member after `.`/`?.`, so the lexer tokenized keyword-named
      fields (`x.after`, `x.until`, `x.state`, `x.type`) as keywords → **syntax error**.
      Broke SPEC's own `"{user.name}"` interpolation pattern and kept
      `transaction_test/bad.velve` from parsing. Fix: shared `RESERVED_WORDS` const +
      new named `member_name` rule (`choice(lower_id, ...RESERVED_WORDS)`) in both `.`
      and `?.` positions; parser regenerated + native binding rebuilt; lowerer unchanged
      (reads `.text`). **Result:** `transaction_test` → green, `transaction_bad` → its
      *intended* semantic error (`missing record field 'attempts'`); corpus 33→32
      failing, **zero regressions**. Unblocks 2a's verification fixtures.

### Phase 2 — Surface breaks (gated on edition `2026.2`)
Largely independent; this order keeps the corpus green between steps. Each ⇒ its own
codemod + full fixture/corpus run before moving on.
- [x] **2a. `Outcome` rename** (§2.7). ✅ DONE, edition-gated. `TxResult`→`Outcome`;
      `Ok/Error`→`Committed/Aborted`; `Conflict/Timeout/Cancelled` stable. Implemented
      as an edition-keyed `OutcomeAdt` descriptor (`infer.ts`): 2026.1 keeps the
      `Ok/Error` constructor-sharing (disambiguated by expected type); 2026.6 uses the
      unique names so the collision is **gone** — match resolves by name (the
      "delete constructor-sharing" goal, realized for 2026.6; legacy path survives only
      while 2026.1 does). `exhaust.ts` registers both `TxResult`+`Outcome` typedefs;
      `resolve.ts` BUILTINS gains `Committed/Aborted`. No runtime change (transactions
      are check-only in eval.ts). **Verified:** new `outcome_test.velve` (2026.6) green;
      legacy `transaction_test/bad.velve` (2026.1) unchanged; gate enforced both ways —
      2026.6 exhaustiveness covers `Committed/Aborted/…`, and old `Ok/Error` against an
      `Outcome` is a type error (`got Result(...)`). Corpus 32→32, zero regressions.
      SPEC §8 outcome table rewritten with both editions + the why-rename rationale.
      No corpus codemod needed (existing fixtures stay on 2026.1 with legacy names).
- [x] **2b. Delete ternary + glue `?`/`?:`** (§2.2). ✅ DONE (core), edition-gated.
      **Plan premise was wrong**: `if c then a else b` did **not** exist (only the
      indented-block `if`; `then` wasn't even a keyword; SPEC:1953 was unrelated). So
      this *built the replacement first*, then deprecated the ternary:
      • New inline `if_then_expr` (`if c then a else b`) — reserved `then`, lowers to the
        same `If` node, right-assoc (else-if ladders), `prec.right` on the two block-`if`
        rules resolves the dangling-else. Grammar regenerated + native rebuilt.
      • Ternary `cond ? a : b` kept in the superset grammar but flagged at lower time:
        **warning 2026.1 / error 2026.6** (lowerer now carries `this.edition`). Verified
        both ways; new `if_then_test.velve` (2026.6) green; corpus zero regressions
        (ternary fixtures gain a warning only). SPEC §3.10/§3.11 rewritten.
      • **`?:` glue — reclassified to fmt (2e).** Once the ternary is gone, the only
        whitespace-keyed meaning (spaced-`?`=ternary vs glued-`?`=propagate) is already
        killed: `?` propagate is `token.immediate` (glued), and spaced `?` has no meaning
        in 2026.6. `?:` is a *distinct* token with no ambiguity either way, and the corpus
        writes it spaced (`x ?: y`) — forcing `token.immediate('?:')` would break those for
        zero semantic gain. Gluing `?:` is a **formatter** preference → folded into 2e.
      • Codemod ternary → `if/then/else`: TODO when migrating the example files (Phase 4).
- [x] **2c. `for…in` + kill `%`** (§2.5, generators). ✅ DONE (core), edition-gated.
      Comprehension generator changed `x = source` → **`x in iter`**, unifying with the
      UI keyed-list `for r in rows` (which already used `in`). **Findings:** the `%`
      sigil was *semantically dead* — `lowerForGen` always dropped it, so `for (r = %rs)`
      ≡ `for (r = rs)`; killing it is pure surface cleanup. And `%` is overloaded — the
      **modulo operator** `x % 2` is untouched (only the for-source sigil died).
      Grammar keeps both generator forms (superset); the lowerer (now edition-aware)
      warns 2026.1 / errors 2026.6 on `=`/`%`, with a `%`-specific message. Multi-gen
      cartesian + guards verified; UI `for_child` intact; new `for_in_test.velve`
      (2026.6) green; corpus zero regressions; SPEC §3.8 rewritten + two stale sites
      fixed. **Deferred:** no-paren single-gen sugar `for x in xs -> e` (ergonomic; the
      parenthesized `for (x in xs) -> e` covers the semantics — adding the bare form
      risks a conflict with `for_child`'s `for x in xs <newline>` and isn't worth the
      grammar risk late in the pass). Codemod for the example files → Phase 4.
- [x] **2d. `#{}` records + SPEC drift** (§2.3/2.4). ✅ DONE (core), edition-gated.
      Record literals + spreads gain the `#{ … }` opener (the form LOCKED in
      `named-args-design.md:282`); bare `{ k: v }` stays in the superset grammar but is
      deprecated (lowerer warns 2026.1 / errors 2026.6), so from 2026.6 `{ … }` is
      **always** a block — the record-vs-block trap is dissolved. **Finding:** record
      *types* (`{ name: Type }`) are a *separate* grammar rule (`record_type`),
      unambiguous in type position → left on bare braces (no change needed). No grammar
      conflicts (the `#{` token is distinct from `{`, hex `#rgb`, and `{`-interpolation).
      The 2d gate caught a real bare-brace record in `outcome_test.velve` (a 2026.6
      fixture) — fixed it to `#{}`, proving the enforcement end-to-end. New
      `record_hash_test.velve` (2026.6) green; corpus zero regressions (the ~110
      bare-brace literals are all on 2026.1 → warn only); SPEC §3.9/§3.17 rewritten.
      Codemod `{k:v}` → `#{k:v}` for the example files → Phase 4.
- [x] **2e. Paren-collapse** (§2.1). ✅ DONE (as a codemod). **Finding:** there is no
      `velve fmt` (CLI has only `check`/`run`/`ast`/`tweaks`) — building a full
      pretty-printer for two cosmetic transforms is disproportionate. Delivered the
      valuable half as `scripts/paren_collapse_codemod.mjs`: unwraps a `grouped` `(E)`
      that is a *direct call argument* (`print((x))`→`print(x)`, `f((a+b), y)`→`f(a+b,
      y)`), leaving tuple args (`f((a, b))` — a `tuple_literal`, not `grouped`) and
      callee parens (`(fn..)(3)`) untouched. **Provably inert**: a grouped call-arg
      lowers identically to its inner expr, verified by byte-identical diagnostics
      (md5) on the 114-collapse file and a byte-identical full-corpus baseline after
      applying. Collapsed **608 parens across 73 files**; corpus now reads clean.
      **`?:` glue dropped:** no formatter to host it, no ambiguity to fix (established
      in 2b) — purely a style nicety, not worth a tokenization break.

### Phase 3 — Deletions (§4)  ✅ DONE (2026-06)
- [x] **3a. Delete `pipe` block** + the `ret` magic identifier. ✅ DONE, edition-gated.
      **Finding:** zero corpus/example uses of the `pipe` block keyword (all matches were
      substrings — `pipeline`, "pipes" in comments) → no codemod needed. The magic `ret`
      has no meaning outside the desugar, so deprecating the block removes both. Kept the
      block in the superset grammar; `lowerPipeBlock` now warns 2026.1 / errors 2026.6
      (SPEC §17 lifecycle), pointing at the multiline `|>` chain as the replacement.
      New fixtures: `pipe_block_2026_1.velve` (warn-only, green) + `pipe_chain_2026_6.velve`
      (the `|>` replacement, clean). Gate verified both ways; corpus 32→32, zero
      regressions. SPEC §3.11 `pipe` entry rewritten with the deprecation + `|>` form.
- [x] **3b. Finish `saga` removal.** ✅ DONE. Kept the deprecated alias path
      (`saga_def`/`saga_alias_test.velve` still warn + run identically — that's the
      alias *test*, left in place). Migrated the last aspirational user
      `examples/checkout.velve`: the expr-form `def checkout … saga CheckoutState` became
      a top-level `machine Checkout(cart: Cart): … persisted over CheckoutState` (steps
      dedented one level; Effect return type rides through since `_type` ⊇ `effect_type`).
      Parses as `DSaga deprecated:false` (canonical machine path); the `saga` keyword is
      gone from `examples/`. Baseline byte-identical (checkout's 14 errs are its
      undefined helpers — Phase 4c, unchanged here).
- [x] Keep `let` and `Char` — **no code change**; documented the `let`/`const` vs bare
      `x =` distinction in SPEC §3.3. **Finding:** the difference is real and
      borrow-checked (`borrow.ts:267,599` keys on `SBind.declares`): `let`/`const`/`mut`
      *declare* a new block-scoped, shadow-capable binding; bare `x =` *reassigns* the
      binding in scope. Documented exactly that (not "redundant sugar").

### Phase 4 — SPEC / example hygiene (§6, §2.3) 🔴 highest leverage  ✅ MOSTLY DONE (2026-06)
This is the root cause of the "I thought we already did X" surprises — decisions
locked in `docs/` never propagated to `SPEC.md`.
- [x] **4a. "What's built ✅/❌" table.** ✅ DONE for `SPEC.md` — new §0.5 build-status
      table (grounded in which fixtures are green), and removed the stale §0 line
      "Type checker implementation (… checker pending)" (the checker exists). Examples
      now carry an "⚠ Aspirational sketch" header (the table points at them).
      **Deferred:** per-design-doc status headers (lower leverage; SPEC is the
      authority and is now reconciled — APCA, message/step rules below).
- [x] **4b. SPEC §3.2 `:`/`=` honesty rewrite.** ✅ DONE. §3.2 retitled "Core symbols";
      `:` documented with its three non-type meanings (record-literal field, atom/step
      label, keyed-list entry) and `=` added with its honest scope (binding + named arg,
      never a type/record field; the `{}=` vs `{}:` trap noted as dissolved by `#{}`).
- [x] **4c.** ✅ DONE (kept examples in place, clearly marked, instead of moving):
      • **Example surface migration** via new `scripts/edition_migrate_codemod.mjs`
        (examples-only): `{ }`→`#{ }` (65), ternary→`if/then/else` (8), `for =/%`→`in` (9).
        **81 deprecation warnings → 0** across all 8 examples; every error count
        byte-identical (type-checker-inert); `?:` Elvis correctly left untouched.
      • **Refinement-in-use:** `taskflow.velve`'s dead `ValidAge` is now used
        (`ageNextYear(a: ValidAge)` + `demoAge`), with an accurate comment (call-site
        literal fold; `.parse` runtime guard; transparent-to-base). Error count unchanged.
      • **Message constructors + implicit-step-match** documented in SPEC §7.2 / §4.1;
        stale `{…}` message/next-state records in SPEC fixed to `#{…}`.
      • **README WCAG→APCA:** the `uiModel` inspector honestly reports the *WCAG ratio*
        today (that's what `render.ts` computes), with APCA Lc named as the color
        system's target; `docs/styles-design.md` `OnSurface` threshold corrected from
        `>= 4.5 -- WCAG AA` to an APCA Lc value.
      **Open structural choice (not done):** physically moving `examples/` →
      `docs/sketches/`. Left in place + marked aspirational; user's call whether to move.
      Corpus stays at 32 error-fixtures; examples now warning-free.

### Phase 5 — Call-syntax phase 2 (§2.1, the last surface inconsistency)
The remaining "three application syntaxes" item. Split into the self-contained
**pattern** unification and the larger **element** surface change.
- [x] **5a. Constructor pattern space→paren** (`| Ok v ->` → `| Ok(v) ->`). ✅ DONE,
      edition-gated. **Finding:** paren-form patterns *already parse* to the identical
      `PCtor` AST (`Ok(v)` ≡ `Ok` + parenthesized `(v)`), so destructuring-as-construction
      needed **no grammar change** — only deprecating the bare form. `checkCtorPatternForm`
      in `lower.ts` flags a ctor pattern with a single *undelimited* payload (warning
      2026.1 / error 2026.6); delimited payloads (`Ok(v)`, `Ok (Chunk c)`, `Ok {body}`) and
      the binding+record triple (`Ok r {body}`) are left untouched. New codemod
      `scripts/ctor_pattern_codemod.mjs` (examples-only, tree-sitter render/stitch) wrapped
      **38 bare patterns across 7 examples**, type-checker-inert (byte-identical error
      counts). Migrated the 2026.6 fixture `outcome_test.velve` by hand (the gate caught its
      bare `Committed n`/… end-to-end). New fixtures: `ctor_pattern_test.velve` (2026.6,
      paren-form, green + runs) and `ctor_pattern_bad.velve` (2026.6, bare form, 2 intended
      errors). **Verified:** check + runtime baselines byte-identical for all 95 prior
      fixtures (only the 2 new files added). SPEC §3.5 documents the rule; SPEC bare-ctor
      *pattern* examples swept to paren-form (19 branch patterns; step-body *constructions*
      like `:abort Error e` left for the separate construction-drift sweep).
- [x] **5b. Element surface space→paren** (`Text "hi" size=12` → `Text("hi", size=12)`).
      ✅ DONE (core), edition-gated. The reader-facing §2.1 win. **As-built:**
      • **Single source of truth** `checker/src/elements.ts` (`PRIMITIVE_MODE` + derived
        `PRIMITIVE_ELEMENTS`), shared by the lowerer and `infer.ts`. The ~20 primitive names
        are **reserved** (a user ADT ctor may not shadow them).
      • **Childless paren elements** are disambiguated from ADT ctors at **lower-time**: a
        `call` whose head is a primitive (`Text(…)`) lowers to an `Element`, not a `Call`
        (`elementFromCall`); `Ok(x)` etc. stay calls. The `Element` AST node is **kept**, so
        infer/eval are byte-identical (no element logic relocated).
      • **Children-bearing paren elements** (`Column(gap=8)` + block) get a dedicated grammar
        rule (`element_args` on `element`/`element_leaf`, `token.immediate('(')`), unambiguous
        vs `call` (which carries no children block). Parser regenerated + native binding rebuilt.
      • **Space-form deprecation** (`checkElementForm`): warning 2026.1 / error 2026.6.
      • Migrated the 2026.6 fixtures (`accessibility_test`/`bad`) by hand — the gate caught
        their space-form end-to-end (and the contrast check correctly re-fires through the
        paren-form tree). New fixtures: `element_paren_test.velve` (childless + children-bearing
        + nested, green + renders HTML) and `element_paren_bad.velve` (space-form in 2026.6, 2
        intended errors).
      • **Verified:** full check + runtime baselines vs post-2B — only intended deltas:
        accessibility error *column* shifts (paren is 1 char wider), the 2 new fixtures, and
        `taskflow` 49→46 (its glued `Text(…)` now resolve as elements instead of
        `unresolved name: Text` — a correctness win). **Zero** new tree-sitter corpus-test
        failures (the 9 pre-existing failures are `member_name` drift, confirmed identical on
        the committed grammar). SPEC §11.1/§11.1.1/§11.3 + scattered examples rewritten to
        paren-form with the deprecation note.
      **Deferred (logged, not silent):** (1) the **examples** codemod
      (`scripts/element_paren_codemod.mjs` exists, migrates 48 elements / skips 12 with
      spread+handler props) is **not applied** — the aspirational examples have *pre-existing
      syntax errors*, so the partial-parse migration isn't byte-identical (±1 error shifts).
      They stay space-form (a 2026.1 warning) until first made syntactically clean.
      (2) **Inline handler props** (`onClick -> body`) and **spread props** (`...rec`) don't map
      to paren `name=value` — they need call-arg-spread + handler-arg grammar (a separate
      build); handlers already attach via the `on …` children block.
- [x] **5c. Delete curried (value-level) juxtaposition** (`add 1 2`). ✅ DONE. **As-found:**
      value juxtaposition was *already* gone — phase 1's unified postfix `call`
      (`token.immediate('(')`) left no spaced-application rule, so `add 1 2` and the juxtaposed
      IIFE `(fn x -> x + 1) 9` are hard syntax errors in **every** edition (not an edition gate).
      This step closed the **doc/reality gap**: SPEC "Calling functions and constructors" and
      "Currying & over-application" no longer claim `add 1 2` is legal; currying is now shown
      only through parens (`add(1)(2)`, partial `add(1)`). New fixtures `juxtaposition_test`
      (green — currying + type-juxtaposition, runs `11766`) / `juxtaposition_bad` (2 syntax
      errors). **Type-level juxtaposition kept** (the locked asymmetry): built-in parametric
      types keep `Result a e` / `Async a` / `Tainted a`; generic types use parens `List(Number)`.
      Corrected a pre-existing SPEC error that listed `List Number` as valid — there is no
      generic `Name T` type juxtaposition (`List Number` is a syntax error). **Verified:**
      baseline delta is exactly the 2 new fixture rows; zero crashes, no source/grammar change.

---

## Track B — Decided semantic gaps (independent of Track A; medium)
Endorsed in review; not part of the surface refactor but cleared to build.
- [x] **Backpressure per-stream policy** (§3.2): ✅ DONE (2026-06). `stream Name : T
      [drop | buffer N | block]` at the declaration site; SPEC §10.1 rewritten (the old
      "drop by default" line was fiction — the as-built queue was an unbounded buffer,
      which stays the no-policy default so every existing stream fixture is untouched).
      `drop` = deliver-to-waiter-else-discard; `buffer N` = bounded, evicts oldest
      (positive-integer literal enforced in the lowerer); `block` = rendezvous — `send`
      parks the producer until a consumer takes the value (deterministic under the
      cooperative scheduler; zero scheduler changes). `Done` is policy-exempt. Surface:
      `buffer`/`block` are CONTEXTUAL words (lower_id in policy position, validated at
      lower time) — making them grammar keywords reserved them globally and broke
      `buffer` as a store state field (`examples/llm_agent.velve`), caught by the corpus
      diff and reverted. Fixtures `stream_policy_test` (ordering/eviction/rendezvous
      proven, runs) + `stream_policy_bad` (2 errors); baselines byte-identical otherwise.
- [x] **Machine `await`→step-goto gap** (§3.2): ✅ DONE (2026-06). Not a grammar
      gap as-found — `await_stmt` parsed inside steps and `_branch_body` already
      admitted `step_goto`; the lowerer's default case silently dropped the statement
      (empty step body). Fixed with one `lowerSagaStmt` case: `await` in a step lowers
      to a `SagaMatch` on a branch-less `Await` subject, so branch bodies get the full
      saga-branch grammar (goto/rollback/blocks) and existing infer/eval/reachability
      walk them unchanged. Self-goto drain loop works (`| Push(e) -> :collect (acc+e)`).
      Fixtures `machine_await_test` (runs, drains a stream to 60) + `machine_await_bad`
      (2 unknown-state errors from await branches); baselines byte-identical otherwise.
- [x] **`try` soundness fix** (§3.5): ✅ DONE (2026-06, `try_sound_test`/`_bad`).
      Deferred monomorphize-then-decide sweep after whole-module inference: Var-typed
      try lines accepted retroactively if they resolve to a concrete non-Result, errors
      if they resolve to Result too late or never. Unknown-callee calls return `Unknown`
      (no leaked leniency vars); `print`/`println` typed; `identity`/`listHead` made real
      (blocks-design §12 updated).
- [x] **Named error ADTs** (§3.5): ✅ DONE (2026-06, SPEC §2.6, `error_adt_test`/`_bad`).
      Prelude single-ctor ADT `ParseError { expected, got, detail }` (registered in
      resolve/infer/exhaust/eval); refinement `T.parse : Base -> Result Base ParseError`;
      `parseNumber` made real end-to-end (was typed-only — neither resolved nor ran) with
      whole-string semantics and the structured error; `Json.parse` structured at runtime.
      Stringly error use is now a check error; SPEC documents the map-at-the-boundary
      domain-ADT convention. Residual: `parseInt`/`parseFloat`/`String.toNumber` still
      stringly; inferred error rows are the separate A+ mechanism (north-star §4).
- [x] **Effect polymorphism** for higher-order fns (§3.6): ✅ DONE (2026-06,
      SPEC §12.4, `hof_effects_test`/`_bad`). The effect of `map(f, xs)` is the
      effect of `f`, charged at the call that supplies it: a function value
      carries latent effects on its `Fn` type, and passing it as an argument
      requires them (conservative — the callee may invoke it). Fires for
      untyped (`map`) and typed (`pmap`) callees; aliasing doesn't launder;
      edition-gated like the pure-hole (1b). Effect rows subsume this later.
- [x] **Module-qualified resolution** (§3.6): ✅ DONE (2026-06, SPEC §5.5,
      `qualified_test`/`_bad`). Capitalized stdlib namespaces are ambient —
      `Math.sqrt(x)` checks (fully typed members) and runs with no import;
      user bindings shadow; lowercase/path forms stay import-only; ambient and
      namespace-import forms share one record type.
- [x] **Error rows v1, S1** (north-star §4; design: `docs/error-rows-design.md`):
      ✅ DONE (2026-06, SPEC §2.13, `error_rows_test`/`_bad`). `Result T _`
      infers a transitive ctor-set row, `?` accumulates by union inside `_`
      defs, a named-ADT ascription pins via ctor-set inclusion (escapees
      listed), recursion among `_` defs rejected; rows close by end-of-module
      fixpoint; prose `String` is uncoverable. Zero corpus impact.
- [x] **Error rows v1, S2**: ✅ DONE (2026-06, `error_rows_match_test`/`_bad`).
      Rows directly matchable — payloads from ctor schemes, match never widens
      the row, exhaustiveness over the ACTUAL raised set: missing ctors named,
      never-raised arms rejected, prose needs catch-all; judged post-closure.
      Error handling re-graded **A → A+**.
- [x] **Error rows S3, shadowing slice**: ✅ DONE (2026-06,
      `ctor_shadow_test`/`_bad`). Shared ctor names resolve by EXPECTED type
      in expression position (deferred behind fresh vars, judged in
      finalizeRows step 0 once the substitution shows the demanded ADT) and
      by scrutinee type in patterns; a row-entry match types the payload from
      the contributing ADT. Declaration order of sharing ADTs no longer
      matters. Remaining S3: mixed-arity shared names, fix-its. Then S4/v2
      (row variables).
- [x] **Error rows S3, late-contribution slice**: ✅ DONE (2026-06,
      `row_late_test`/`_bad`). The S1 Var leniency closed — a `?` whose callee
      error type is still a Var when the line is checked (forward call to an
      unascribed-param def or `let` lambda) is deferred and re-judged in
      finalizeRows step 0.5; the late contribution reaches the row, its pins,
      and its match verdicts. Never-contributable types are rejected (still
      polymorphic → "annotate or pin"; concrete non-ADT → named); only
      `Unknown` stays lenient. S1 dropped these silently — pins passed
      vacuously over under-approximated rows.
- [x] **Error rows S3, fix-it slice**: ✅ DONE (2026-06,
      `row_fixit_test`/`_bad`). A failing pin names the smallest edit that
      makes it hold: re-pin with an already-declared covering ADT (smallest
      ctor count wins) and/or add the missing variants, spelled in
      declaration syntax. Green fixture = the suggestion applied. S3 closed
      except mixed-arity shared names, which turned out to be
      runtime-ambiguous (eval binds each ctor name once — function if
      payloaded, bare value if nullary) and waits on an eval redesign.
      Next: S4/v2 row variables.
- [x] **Row variables (S4/v2) design note**: ✅ DONE (2026-06,
      `docs/row-variables-design.md`). v2 worked out against the as-built
      v1: row-polymorphic SIGNATURES over the v1 flow core — tails are
      quantified vars cloned per call site at instantiate and judged by the
      existing finalize step 0.5; no new unification on the error side.
      Probes exposed the real prerequisite: NO function-type ascription
      exists in the surface (lower never produces TRFn; checker is ready),
      and row defs are mono (rows × generics unusable). Sliced: S4a fn-type
      ascriptions, S4b row tails, S4c effect tails on builtin HOFs (the
      §12.4 replacement; Fn-unify must learn effect tails). Next: S4a.
- [x] **Function-type ascriptions (S4a)**: ✅ DONE (2026-06, SPEC §2.14,
      `fn_type_test`/`_bad`). `(A -> B)` / `(A, B -> C)` / `(() -> T)` in
      any ascription slot; parens mandatory (bare return-slot `->` is the
      single-line body); lone `()` = empty param list (the zero-param def
      shape); composes with user generics. Grammar + lower only — the
      checker was TRFn-ready. Green: pass-through error polymorphism under
      a pin, n-ary, thunk, return-slot closure. Bad: 4 boundary errors
      unascribed params could never surface. Zero corpus impact.
- [x] **Row tails (S4b)**: ✅ DONE (2026-06, SPEC §2.13 v2 block,
      `row_tails_test`/`_bad`). The v2 core: row defs compose with generics,
      a callback's error var is a TAIL on the row, and each use judges a
      per-call-site clone (⊇ base) — the same def pins differently at each
      call, row-matches are exhaustive over THIS call's set, and generic
      non-HOF row defs are callable (layers 2+3 closed). Union + extension
      green; bad fixture pins 4 errors (tail escapee with covering-pin
      fix-it, unresolved tail ×2, open-row match without catch-all).
      As-built delta: tails register via a deferred finalize step 0.4
      (callers can check before the def's body fills its tails); judging is
      the existing step 0.5 verbatim. Zero corpus impact.
- [x] **Effect tails (S4c)**: ✅ DONE (2026-06, SPEC §12.4 effect-tails
      block, `effect_tails_test`/`_bad`). Builtin HOF signatures carry an
      effect tail (`Fn.effectTail?: number`, a quantified id; `EFFECT_TAILS`
      accumulates per-call bindings; Fn-unify's one effect rule: a declared
      tail absorbs the other side's row). `pmap`/`pfilter` charge the
      argument's row precisely per call site; `identity` (tail on own row
      only — never invokes) accepts an effectful fn uncharged, with no
      laundering (the value keeps its row for the per-call check). The
      conservative §12.4 rule defers to tailed signatures and governs
      untailed callees (surface `map`/`filter`, user HOFs) unchanged.
      Zero corpus impact (`hof_effects_bad` stays 4 — its pmap case now
      fails via the tail). S4/v2 complete; E2 user-spelled tails deferred.
- [x] **User-spelled effect rows (E2)**: ✅ DONE (2026-06, SPEC §12.4 E2
      block, `effect_spell_test`/`_bad`). The S4c tails handed to user code:
      `..e` inside the existing `Effect [...]` bracket — a param fn-type
      (`f: (String -> Effect [..e] String)`) BINDS the argument's row per
      call site; the def's own clause (`Effect [..e]` / `Effect [io, ..e]`)
      CHARGES the caller. Zero new syntax concepts (effect_type was already
      a _type — one grammar extension admits the tail in the bracket) and
      zero new checker rules (tail names quantify in generalizeSig beside
      type vars, namespaced "..e"; substVars/bindEffectTails/fnEffectRow run
      verbatim). Latent-rule skip widened to tail-AWARE (own or param Fn),
      making the identity pattern spellable: `keep(netGet)` uncharged, the
      value keeps its row. Guardrails: ≤1 tail per row; unbound clause/
      return tails error; a tail-only clause is a declared-EMPTY pool (the
      tail never licenses the body). Baseline diff = the new fixtures only.
      Found (pre-existing): untailed fn-type ascriptions erase effects —
      effects don't unify; documented as its own future slice.
- [x] **Ascription effect-coverage**: ✅ DONE (2026-06, SPEC §12.4 coverage
      block, `effect_ascribe_test`/`_bad`). The E2 dig's laundering hole
      closed: a concrete fn-type ascription must COVER the value's effect
      row — directional (declared ⊇ actual; over-approximating is legal),
      checked at the ascription boundaries (def returns, let bindings in
      both block and try bodies) rather than inside unify
      (accumulate-never-unify stays law). Walks covariant structure (fn
      rets, type args, tuples, record fields, Stream/Async inners) so the
      row can't hide in a record field or list element; error names the
      missing row + both fix-its. Tail-spelled returns exempt at top level
      (the tail owns the row); fn params stay with the conservative §12.4
      rule (contravariant — direction flips). Caught a genuine erasure in
      effect_tails_test's `keep` (S4c-era) — fixture corrected to spell
      `(String -> Effect [io] String)`. Baseline diff = the new bad
      fixture only.
- [x] **Tier-1 `@total` structural totality (proof-gradient slice 1)**: ✅ DONE
      (2026-06, SPEC §12.6, totality-design §9 as-built, `total_test`/`_bad`).
      The north-star §3 gradient's first checked obligation: `@total def f`
      (parses via the existing decorator rule — zero grammar changes) is held
      to its promise by a standalone syntactic pass (`total.ts`): recursion
      must decrease at ONE position (ctor/tuple/record destructuring descent,
      or `n - k` under a literal/comparison floor with a recursion-free path),
      and totality flows DOWN the call graph — total calls only total fns +
      terminating builtins; HOF builtins need a checkable fn (lambda /
      local-let lambda / total name); `loop`/`await`/spawn/host/elements
      rejected in total bodies. Conservative rejects (pinned in `_bad`, 8
      errors): mutual recursion (cycle pass, one error per fn), closure
      recursion, fn-param calls, non-total builtins. §3.5 finding recorded:
      module-private ctors = language change (flat resolver scope) — gates
      the refined-type tier only. Deferred follow-on: §5.1 constEval folding
      of @total predicates (corpus-wide, own slice). Baseline diff = the two
      new fixture rows.
- [x] **`Proof [...]` module scope (proof-gradient slice 2)**: ✅ DONE
      (2026-06, SPEC §12.7, `proof_scope_test`/`_bad`). `proofs: [total,
      exhaustive]` in module heads — `proofs_decl` mirrors `capabilities_decl`
      in the grammar (additive; corpus case added; the 9 pre-existing corpus
      failures unchanged). The dual of capabilities: effects flow UP, proofs
      flow DOWN into every def the module contains. Vocabulary CLOSED at
      lower time (`total bounds nonzero arith overflow exhaustive handled`);
      declared = enforced — unknown obligation → error; not-checkable-yet
      obligation (`bounds` etc.) → error naming what IS checkable; never a
      silent skip. `total`: lower marks each contained DFn implicitly @total
      (total.ts untouched — decrease check + downward gate fire as if the
      decorator were present); `exhaustive`: clause-head gaps harden to
      errors in EVERY edition (a `hardened` flag through checkClauseHeads;
      the bad fixture is deliberately baseline-edition to prove the
      obligation beats the 2026.6 gate). Found while fixturing: payload-ctor
      clause heads (`def f(Rise(n))`) are grammar-ambiguous with
      function_sig types — the exhaustive fixture dispatches on nullary
      ctors (the safe subset's shape anyway). `proof_scope_bad` = exactly 5
      errors; run-mode refuses it (vocabulary errors are lower-stage —
      correct: a module promising an unknown obligation shouldn't run).
      Baseline diff = the two new fixture rows. North-star §3.6 items 1, 2,
      4 ✅.
- [x] **§3 + Security re-grade (proof-gradient slice 3, completes the plan)**:
      ✅ DONE (2026-06, docs-only — no code, no fixtures, baselines untouched
      by construction). Security row A → **A+** in both grade tables
      (north-star §1, TODO §1): the field's exemplars ship ONE gradient
      (capability security, effects up — Austral/Pony/Koka); Velve ships the
      dual pair under one declaration shape, both closed vocabularies, both
      declared = enforced, every known effect-laundering route closed +
      per-obligation proof rollout live. The §3.6 re-grade block argues the
      construct's A+ on four grounds: vocabulary held through two slices of
      compiler contact (zero obligations added/renamed); rollout promise
      kept loudly (no-checker obligations are errors, never skips — a
      partially-implemented gradient that's SOUND); the direction rule
      survived contact (proofs-flow-down IS the downward gate, reused
      untouched by the module scope); every unshipped obligation has a named
      blocker — and `handled`'s (§4 error rows) has since shipped, making it
      the cheapest next obligation (§3.4 table updated). Honesty items: the
      ambient-stdout DECIDED hole is now on record in both Security rows;
      §10 evidence basis updated (the gradient is no longer "design-on-design,
      none built"); §9 reading guide updated. Explicitly NOT bought: the
      Type-core row stays A− — its named gap (the conservative skip) is
      untouched; its promoted next lever is §5.1 constEval widening (fold
      predicates whose call-closure is @total), now named in the Type-core
      row itself. Remaining recorded levers after this plan: §5.1 (own
      slice, corpus-wide inference), refined-type library (gated on
      module-private ctors — language change), per-def/per-block proof
      scopes (PROPOSED), Tier-2 Z3.
- [x] **§5.1 constEval widening — fold `@total` predicates at check time
      (the promoted follow-on; Type-core A− → A)**: ✅ DONE (2026-06,
      SPEC §2.6 + §12.6, totality-design §9, `constfold_total_test`/`_bad`
      — exactly 3 errors; baselines unchanged except the two new rows; no
      grammar change). The totality promise is what makes running user code
      inside the checker safe, so `constEval` now applies `@total` functions
      (decorator or module `proofs: [total]` — both arrive via DFn.total) to
      constant arguments: clause dispatch over a DECIDABLE pattern matcher
      (literals/tuples/records; ctor/atom patterns sink the whole fold —
      an undecidable branch can't be skipped, it could select the wrong
      arm), bodies fold through if/match/straight-line immutable let blocks
      and recursion. Fuel-bounded (100k applications) because Number ≠ Nat
      (`factorial(-1)` must exhaust into a conservative skip, never hang
      the checker); named-arg calls, defaults, mut, control statements,
      module-const refs in bodies all bail. Engine: infer.ts — TOTAL_FNS
      registered in registerAliases; constEval became a fuel-resetting
      wrapper over the recursive `ceval`; new If/Match/Do fold cases +
      applyTotalFn/tryMatchConst. Builtin folds keep name priority. Honest
      find recorded in docs: runtime refinement enforcement is the explicit
      `T.parse` boundary ONLY, so pre-§5.1 `half(3)` against an
      `isEven(value)` refinement was accepted and ran unchecked — this fold
      is the only check such calls get. Type-core re-graded A− → **A** in
      both tables (north-star §1 + §3.6 closing block + §3.2/§10; TODO §1);
      remaining → A+: refined-type library (gated on module-private ctors)
      + Tier-2 Z3.
- [x] **`handled` — the third checkable proof obligation**: ✅ DONE
      (2026-06, SPEC §12.7, `proof_handled_test`/`_bad` — exactly 4 errors;
      baselines unchanged except the two new rows; no grammar change). Its
      §4 blocker (error rows) had shipped, making it the cheapest obligation
      on the board. `proofs: [handled]` = no def in the module silently
      discards a `Result`: a Result-typed expression in a dropped statement
      position (non-final in do/try/retry/transaction, ANY position in a
      loop body) is an error; match/`?`/bind/return are the sanctioned
      paths, and deliberate discards are rejected too (the escape hatch is
      not declaring the obligation — gradient-wide rule). New pass
      `checker/src/handled.ts` (mirrors exhaust's module walk; consumes the
      inference types map; conservative on unresolved Vars), wired into
      index.ts + lsp.ts; lower.ts PROOF_CHECKABLE += handled (the
      not-checkable error message now lists three). Design point recorded
      in SPEC §12.7 + north-star §3.4: obligations have two enforcement
      shapes — `total` is call-graph (downward gate), `exhaustive`/`handled`
      are scope-local (fault is syntactic to the scope) — so no downward
      gate for handled is principled, not a shortcut. Green fixture also
      witnesses scope-locality: the same discard OUTSIDE the module is
      legal. v1 scope: function bodies (store/machine/saga bodies
      documented out). Surface gap found: wildcard binds (`let _ = e`)
      don't parse — the PWild discard check in handled.ts is defensive
      for when they land. 3 of 6 obligations now checkable; remaining:
      `bounds`/`nonzero` (flow-sensitive fact env, §3.1 catch 1),
      `overflow` (sized types, §5).
- [x] **`@private type` — module-private constructors (north-star §3.5,
      the refined-type tier's soundness gate)**: ✅ DONE (2026-06, SPEC
      §7.1, `private_ctor_test`/`_bad` — exactly 4 errors; baselines
      unchanged except the two new rows; no grammar change — `@private`
      rides the generic decorator rule like `@total` did). An ADT declared
      `@private` inside a module seals its constructors at the module
      boundary in BOTH directions: outside code can neither call the ctor
      (forging a value that skipped validation) nor pattern-match it
      (depending on the hidden representation); the type NAME stays public
      for signatures. Validation at lower: `@private` on a def errors
      (fn privacy not v1); on an alias/refinement errors (transparent to
      base — their boundary is `.parse`); at resolve: needs an enclosing
      module. Implementation matched the §3.5 "small language change"
      read: resolver scope stays FLAT — Binding gains `privateTo`, the
      Resolver tracks a moduleStack through both passes, and privacy is a
      use-site check at the Var lookup + a new PCtor head lookup (patterns
      never resolved their head before; typing catches unknown ctors, but
      privacy had to). ast.ts DType += private_; lower.ts decorator_def
      case applies it. **The §3.6 item-3 gate fell**: the refined-type
      library (`Natural`/`NonZero`/`Positive`/`InBounds` as @private ADTs
      + smart constructors + closed ops) is now a pure library add — the
      Type-core row's named next lever, no longer blocked on language
      work. Grade tables updated (no re-grade — the row moved to A last
      slice; this unblocks its → A+ path).
- [x] **Tier-1 refined-type library (north-star §3.3 item 3 — the
      `@private type` payoff)**: ✅ DONE (2026-06, SPEC §7.1,
      `refined_types_test`/`_bad` — exactly 4 errors; baselines unchanged
      except the two new rows; **zero checker changes** — the "pure
      library add" prediction held exactly). `module refined` ships
      `Natural`/`NonZero`/`Positive`/`InBounds` as `@private` ADTs:
      smart-constructor **gates** from raw Number returning Result
      (`natural`/`nonZero`/`positive`/`inBounds(i, xs)`), **closed ops**
      that stay in the type with no re-check (`natAdd`/`natMul`/`posMul`/
      `posToNat` — the Positive ⊆ Natural embedding), **faulting ops**
      back through the gate (`natSub` → `Result Natural String`), and
      witness-consuming ops that DELETE fault cases from the type:
      `divBy(n, d: NonZero)` is total division and `getAt(xs, ix:
      InBounds)` is safe indexing — passing a raw 0 / raw index is a
      type error, pinned by the `_bad` twin alongside forge-by-call and
      match-by-pattern. The module is itself proof-carrying —
      `proofs: [total, exhaustive, handled]` — every def discharges all
      three shipped obligations (the gradient eats its own cooking; the
      in-module indexing kernel `head`/`slice` is in TOTAL_BUILTINS).
      As-built deltas from the §3.3 sketch: no `@unsafe{}` TCB needed
      (the module boundary IS the trusted kernel); gates spell as module
      fns (`natural(n)`, not `Natural.parse`); `SortedList` deferred
      (sortedness is the §3.2 semantic case — Tier 2's job). Honest
      Tier-1 bound, documented loudly: `InBounds` witnesses "an index
      that passed a bounds check", NOT "an index into THAT list" — the
      relational tie (`Index(xs)`) is Tier 1.5's witness-token
      primitive, deliberately not faked. Until multi-file imports
      resolve, the library travels by inclusion;
      `refined_types_test.velve` is the reference source. No re-grade:
      Type-core's remaining → A+ was "library + Tier-2"; one of two
      landed, so the row holds A with remaining = Tier-2 Z3 + the
      Tier-1.5 witness.
- [x] **`nonzero` + the flow-sensitive fact env (Tier-2 groundwork,
      north-star §3.1 catch 1)**: ✅ DONE (2026-06, `checker/src/facts.ts`,
      SPEC §12.7, `proof_nonzero_test`/`_bad` — exactly 6 errors; baselines
      unchanged except the two new rows). The fourth checkable obligation:
      in a `proofs: [nonzero]` module every `/` and `%` divisor must be
      PROVED nonzero — the runtime fault is silent (JS division poisons
      with Infinity/NaN), so there is no error to handle after the fact.
      The engine is the fact env the north-star named "the real
      engineering lift, bigger than the solver call": comparison-to-
      constant facts on immutable names from if/else (negated on else),
      `&&`/`||`/`not`, match literals + fall-through binders (the
      factorial idiom), branch guards, `for` filters, and earlier
      multi-clause literal heads (`def recip(0) -> …` makes the next
      clause's binder != 0); `mut`/reassignment kills facts; facts
      survive into lambdas (immutable names are frozen at the test).
      Entailment is the no-solver interval floor (`!= 0`, `== k≠0`,
      `> k≥0`, `≥ k>0`, `< k≤0`, `≤ k<0`). Deliberate Tier-2 pin in the
      `_bad` twin: `if a != b then n / (a - b)` is a SUFFICIENT guard the
      floor can't use — compound divisors error with a message naming the
      Z3 fall-through, so the residue is a concrete error, not a sketch.
      Scope-local like `exhaustive`/`handled` (no downward gate). Checker
      changes: facts.ts (new), lower.ts PROOF_CHECKABLE + message,
      index.ts/lsp.ts wiring; `proof_scope_bad` untouched (it pins
      `bounds` as the not-checkable example). The Z3 back-end was blocked
      on the dependency at ship time — it landed the NEXT slice (below),
      once the user installed `z3-solver`. No re-grade: type-core holds A;
      this is groundwork named inside its remaining → A+ path, not the
      path itself.
- [x] **The Tier-2 Z3 back-end for `nonzero` (north-star §3.3 tier 2,
      first slice)**: ✅ DONE (2026-06, `checker/src/smt.ts`, SPEC §12.7,
      `proof_nonzero_z3_test`/`_bad` — 0 and exactly 3 errors; baseline
      diff: the two new rows plus `proof_nonzero_bad` 6 → 5, the
      deliberate graduation). Two-tier discharge as designed: facts.ts
      went symbolic (facts are now comparisons between translatable
      TERMS — names, numeric literals, `+`/`-`/`*`/unary minus — not just
      name-vs-constant; the interval floor reads the constant subset),
      and divisors the floor can't settle but CAN translate become a
      residue `checkNonZero` returns; the CLI awaits
      `dischargeNonZero(residue)` — per obligation: assert every path
      fact, assert divisor == 0, UNSAT over ℝ ⟹ proved; SAT surfaces the
      **counterexample model** in the error (`a = 0.0, b = 0.0`); UNKNOWN
      conservative. The case the floor slice pinned in
      `proof_nonzero_bad` (`if a != b then n / (a - b)`) GRADUATED to the
      z3 green fixture verbatim — floor-pin-graduate is the
      per-obligation rollout working at the solver tier; the green
      fixture also proves strict-order guards, one guard covering two
      divisors, and guard-free nonlinear `d * d + 1`. Soundness work this
      slice: a per-clause prepass collects every `mut`/reassignment
      target so facts never attach to mutable names (closes a nested-loop
      invalidation hole the v1 floor had); the solver only ever REMOVES
      floor errors, never accepts what it can refute. Ops/honesty:
      z3-solver loads lazily (~120 ms init, measured; empty residue
      never pays), worker threads terminated after discharge or Node
      hangs; missing package degrades to floor errors + install hint;
      the LSP (sync pipeline) shows the conservative floor, the CLI is
      authoritative; Z3 reasons over ℝ not IEEE doubles — benign for
      this obligation (gradual underflow: `a - b == 0` iff `a == b`
      for doubles; overflow to ±Infinity is nonzero). Uninterpreted
      divisors (`length(xs)`, projections) stay floor errors — §3.1
      catch 2 is structural, the witness types remain their answer.
      Checker changes: smt.ts (new), facts.ts rewrite, index.ts await,
      lsp.ts floor surface; `z3-solver` added to checker/package.json
      (user-installed). No re-grade: type-core holds A — the row's → A+
      named the SEMANTIC residue (`proof.terminates`, `proof.sorted`) +
      the Tier-1.5 witness; the solver those need is now live, the
      obligations themselves are not.
- [x] **`proof.terminates` — the Z3 measure check for @total (north-star
      §3.3 Tier 2, second slice)**: ✅ DONE (2026-06,
      `checker/src/terminates.ts`, SPEC §12.6,
      `proof_terminates_test`/`_bad` — 0 and exactly 3 errors; baselines
      unchanged except the two new rows; `total_bad` holds at 8 with its
      `hang`/`grow` now routed through Z3 and still failing). The valve
      totality-design §3 promised, automatic under `@total` — no
      `proof.terminates` spelling, the std/proof surface stays proposed.
      Flow: total.ts's "no argument position structurally decreases"
      failure becomes a MeasureCandidate when the walker raised nothing
      else (closures/escapes/forbidden nodes/call gate/mutual recursion
      keep the plain Tier-1 reject); terminates.ts re-walks each clause
      with the fact env (facts.ts refactored to a visitor-based
      `walkFacts` — the nonzero check now rides the same walker) and
      builds per-position attempts: per recursive call, F ⟹ arg ≤ n − 1
      (UNIT decrease) and F ⟹ n ≥ 0 (floor), as refutation queries; one
      fully-UNSAT position ⟹ proved. Unit decrease over ℝ is the
      soundness keystone for float Numbers (strict decrease alone is
      Zeno); it is why `halve(n / 2)` proves under `if n < 2` but not
      `if n <= 0` — and Z3's counterexample (n = 1) names the gap in the
      error. Non-constant decreases prove (`shrink(n - k, k)` under
      `k >= 1` — beyond any structural rule); `k > 0` fails with k = 1/2,
      `k != 0` fails with k = -1, the model always pointing at the guard
      bug; a fractional decrease known only by fact (k ∈ (0,1)) is
      conservatively rejected — the measure demands a whole step. smt.ts
      restructured around one primitive (a fact set that must be UNSAT)
      serving both obligations in one lazy init. Honesty: ≥ 2^53 float
      rounding can absorb a unit decrease (documented in SPEC §12.6 with
      the Number ≠ Nat caveat); LSP shows the structural floor error.
      Translatable fragment extended with division by nonzero literals.
      NO re-grade: type-core holds A — remaining → A+ is now the semantic
      case proper (`proof.sorted`/`SortedList`) + the Tier-1.5 witness.
- [x] **`bounds` — the fifth checkable obligation (north-star §3.4)**:
      ✅ DONE (2026-06, SPEC §12.7, `proof_bounds_test`/`_bad` — 0 and
      exactly 7 errors; baselines unchanged except the new fixture rows).
      Every list index read in a `proofs: [bounds]` module proved
      `0 ≤ i < length(xs)`; strings exempt (out-of-range pads with "", no
      fault), dicts exempt (missing key is `handled`'s family) — the split
      comes from inferred types, so `checkBounds(mod, types, resolutions)`.
      The new engine piece is the fact env's first FUNCTION SYMBOL:
      `length(xs)` — the builtin (no resolutions entry; a user `length`
      resolves and stays opaque), on an immutable name (mutation kills via
      termNames; a mut list never carries length facts, a push would
      falsify them) — enters the translatable fragment and becomes an
      Int-sorted Z3 constant `len$xs` with `≥ 0` asserted (ToReal-wrapped:
      Real→Int casts throw in the JS API, Int→Real is exact).
      Int-sortedness is the payoff: `length(xs) > 0` entails `≥ 1`, so
      `xs[length(xs) - 1]` proves — over ℝ alone length could be ½.
      Two refutation queries per read (facts ∧ i < 0; facts ∧ i ≥ len),
      the error names which side leaked with the model (`i = -1.0`;
      `i = 0.0, length(xs) = 0.0`). Runtime floors fractional indices:
      0 ≤ i ∧ i < len over ℝ ⟹ 0 ≤ ⌊i⌋ < len for integer len, so the
      real proof is sound for the floored read (and the floor's lower
      side rejects `i > -1` — it admits −0.5, which floors to −1).
      Sync interval floor keeps the guarded-read idiom
      (`if i >= 0 && i < length(xs)`) LSP-clean. Cross-obligation
      graduation: `length` interpreted means the nonzero `_bad` pin
      `n / length(xs)` moved to `proof_nonzero_z3_test` guarded-and-proved
      (`head(xs)` re-pins the uninterpreted class), and `proof_scope_bad`'s
      not-checkable-yet pin moved `bounds` → `arith` (counts hold at 3/5).
      v1 scope: reads (writes require `mut`, which kills length facts —
      proved writes are InBounds-witness territory, documented). 5 of 6
      obligations checkable; not-yet is down to `arith`/`overflow`.
      NO re-grade: type-core holds A — the → A+ residue was never bounds;
      it remains `proof.sorted`/`SortedList` + the Tier-1.5 witness, and
      the cheap side-tracks are now spent.
- [x] **`SortedList` — the semantic archetype, construct-it route
      (north-star §3.2)**: ✅ DONE (2026-06, SPEC §7.1,
      `sorted_list_test`/`_bad` — 0 errors + runs, and exactly 4 errors;
      baselines unchanged except the new fixture rows). Sortedness has no
      structural proxy, so the no-solver option is the smart constructor:
      the order check (`isSorted` — `all` over `zip(xs, tail(xs))` adjacent
      pairs) runs exactly once at the gate, and every closed op preserves
      the invariant BY CONSTRUCTION. Two sound gates: `sortedList` PARSES
      (rejects unsorted — never silently sorts) and `fromAny` sorts — as
      built by `foldl(slInsert, SortedList([]), xs)`, construction never
      touching the representation (also dodged a live infer/eval `sortBy`
      arg-order disagreement: infer types `sortBy(xs, keyFn)`, eval expects
      `sortBy(cmp, xs)` — pre-existing, noted, not this slice's fix).
      Closed ops: `slInsert` filter-split (`<= x`, x, `> x` — never
      re-sorted, never re-checked), `slMerge`. Payoff op `slMin`: O(1)
      `head`, only "the minimum" on sorted input — a CORRECTNESS
      precondition (vs `divBy`/`getAt`'s safety), made unforgeable.
      Proof-carrying (`proofs: [total, exhaustive, handled]`); pure
      library add, zero checker changes (second time the §3.5 prediction
      held exactly). `_bad` pins forge-by-call, match-by-pattern,
      raw-list-where-witness-demanded, PLUS the doctrinal fourth:
      `proofs: [sorted]` is a vocabulary error — the §3.4
      operations/values split enforced, not just documented. The
      `proof.sorted` Z3 spelling stays a proposed ALTERNATIVE (zero
      ceremony, readability tax), no longer the only path. NO re-grade:
      type-core holds A — remaining → A+ is now exactly ONE item, the
      Tier-1.5 relational witness (`Index(xs)`); a `bounds`+`terminates`
      binary-search showcase is the natural fixture once it lands
      (fractional-index float semantics make its measure facts a slice of
      their own — probed, deliberately not rushed into this one).
- [x] **The Tier-1.5 relational witness — `Index(length(xs))`
      (north-star §3.3)**: ✅ DONE (2026-06, SPEC §2.7 + §12.7,
      `index_witness_test`/`_bad` — 0 errors + runs `60/40/22/-1/30`, and
      exactly 4 errors; baselines unchanged except the four new rows). The
      last named → A+ ingredient: ties an index to THAT list, which the
      InBounds ADT deliberately doesn't fake. As built: NOT a new type or
      vocabulary word — the existing dependent-refinement surface
      (`type Index n = Number where 0 <= value && value < n`, used
      `Index(length(xs))` over a sibling param) joined to the existing
      bounds fact pipeline by two bridges. DEMAND (infer.ts records a
      `WITNESS_DEMANDS` entry per call argument constEval can't settle;
      facts.ts proves it inside `proofs: [bounds]` scopes — interval floor,
      then Z3 as a `BoundsObligation` with witness-aware prose): check once
      at a guard, spend at every call the branch covers; a cross-list spend
      (`crossed` checks xs, spends on ys) is refuted with the model that
      splits them (`length(xs) = 1, length(ys) = 0`). SEED (facts.ts
      `witnessSeeds`): the callee assumes its witness params' facts, so
      `xs[i]` in the body needs NO guard — assume/guarantee at the
      signature; sound in the proved region because proved callers
      discharged the demand, and an unproved caller keeps today's skip (the
      gradient) with the loud runtime fault as the floor. v1 honest bounds
      (documented in SPEC): params only — return-position witnesses and the
      `Result`-gate spelling (`checkBounds(i, xs)`) need binder seeding
      (SHIPPED the next slice — see the return-gate box below);
      fn-as-value / partial application escape the
      demand; the demanded list must be a bare name. `_bad` pins the
      relational tie on BOTH bridges (demand-side cross-list, seed-side
      wrong-read), the missing lower guard, and the nameless list. Zero
      grammar changes, zero eval.ts changes (the witness is transparent
      Number at runtime). RE-GRADE: Type-core A → A+ (north-star §1) — the
      gradient complete in kind (Tiers 0/1/1.5/2); not claimed: cheaper
      hard proofs than F★, Idris-native dependent ergonomics,
      `arith`/`overflow`. The binary-search showcase stays queued behind
      its own measure-facts slice.
- [x] **The return-gate witness spelling — `Result Index(length(xs)) e`
      (endgame A1)**: ✅ DONE (2026-06, SPEC §2.7 + §12.7,
      `index_gate_test`/`_bad` — 0 errors + runs `30/-1/40/40`, and exactly
      4 errors; baselines unchanged except the two new rows). The named
      follow-on from the Tier-1.5 witness: the witness now travels in RETURN
      position through the Result gate, a checked constructor for it. Two more
      bridges, no new type/vocabulary. GUARANTEE (infer.ts: an `Ok(payload)`
      inside a fn whose `ctx.returnType` resolves to `Result Index(length(p)) e`
      records a `WITNESS_DEMANDS` entry on the payload — facts.ts then proves it
      from the body's path facts, so the gate cannot hand back an out-of-range
      index; `Ok(length(xs) - 1)` under `length(xs) > 0` proves). SEED (infer.ts
      records the gate call in `WITNESS_RETURNS` with the caller's actual list
      substituted for the callee param; facts.ts `walkBranch` seeds
      `0 ≤ j < length(xs)` onto the `Ok(j)` match-binder, so `xs[j]` reads with
      no guard). `_bad` pins both bridges: GUARANTEE (no guard, half-guard, and
      the relational cross-list gate) and SEED (the relational wrong-read). v1
      honest bounds: the gate rides the Result form (the `match` `Ok`-binder).
      Zero grammar changes, zero eval.ts changes.
- [x] **The bare-return witness spelling — `Index(length(xs))` direct, the
      `let`-direct half (endgame A1)**: ✅ DONE (2026-06, SPEC §2.7 + §12.7,
      `index_let_test`/`_bad` — 0 errors + runs `30/30/30/20`, and exactly
      4 errors; baselines unchanged except the two new rows — verified by the
      stash-dance, the 193-row check AND run corpora IDENTICAL old-vs-new). The
      last A1 follow-on: the witness now also rides the UNWRAPPED return. A def
      returning a bare `Index(length(xs))` (no `Result`, no Error escape hatch)
      is total, so the GUARANTEE applies to EVERY tail position — `infer.tailExprs`
      walks If/Match/Await/Do-block leaves and records a `WITNESS_DEMANDS` entry
      on each, which facts.ts proves from that branch's path facts (the `then`
      tail can prove while its `else` sibling fails — they're checked
      independently). SEED: `bareWitnessRet` records the gate call in
      `WITNESS_RETURNS` (sharing the Result-gate table via `?? `), and
      facts.ts `walkStmt`'s `SBind` seeds `0 ≤ j < length(xs)` onto the `let`
      binder — the `let` dual of `walkBranch`'s `Ok(j)` seed — so `xs[j]` reads
      with no `match`, no guard. `_bad` pins both bridges four ways: GUARANTEE
      (construction overshoot `i + 1`, one-tail-unproven-while-sibling-proves,
      the relational cross-list return), SEED (the relational wrong-read).
      Zero grammar changes, zero eval.ts changes. **A1 now fully shipped.**
- [x] **`arith` — the partial-arithmetic-domain obligation (endgame A2)**:
      ✅ DONE (2026-06, SPEC §12.7, `proof_arith_test`/`_bad` — 0 errors + runs
      `3/0/0/9/4/4/0`, and exactly 4 errors; baselines unchanged except the two
      new rows). The sixth checkable obligation, same engine as `nonzero`/`bounds`:
      in a `proofs: [arith]` module every call to a domain-restricted math builtin
      must have its argument proved inside the domain — `sqrt` needs `x ≥ 0`,
      `log`/`log2`/`log10` need `x > 0`, `asin`/`acos` need `-1 ≤ x ≤ 1`. The
      faults are the silent-NaN kind (`sqrt(-1)`, `log(0)`, `asin(2)` return NaN,
      not an error), the same "no error to handle" shape that motivates `nonzero`.
      As built: a per-builtin **domain table** of one or two interval constraints
      (facts.ts `ARITH_DOMAINS`), discharged on the two existing tiers — the
      interval floor settles a literal and a guarded bare name
      (`if x >= 0 then sqrt(x)`, the `&&`-distributed `-1 <= x && x <= 1` for
      `asin`), and anything translatable-but-unsettled goes to Z3 as a refutation
      (`facts ∧ ¬(arg op k)` unsat ⟹ in domain), so `sqrt(a * a)` and
      `if a > b then log(a - b)` discharge guard-free; a failed query reports the
      out-of-domain model (`x = -1.0`, `x = 0.0`, `x = 2.0`). Both surface
      spellings reach the table — ambient `Math.sqrt(x)` and bare `sqrt(x)` (a
      user binding shadows first and carries a resolution entry, so a resolved
      callee is not the builtin and stays opaque, like `length`). Scope-local;
      v1 scope: function bodies. Cross-obligation graduation: `proof_scope_bad`'s
      not-checkable-yet pin moved `arith` → `overflow` (counts hold at 5 errors).
      **Vocabulary 6/7 checkable — only `overflow` (sized-types substrate, §5)
      remains.** Zero grammar changes, zero eval.ts changes. NO re-grade:
      type-core holds A+; this deepens the gradient within kind.
- [x] **Floored measures + the binary-search showcase (endgame A3)**:
      ✅ DONE (2026-06, SPEC §12.6, `proof_binsearch_test`/`_bad` — 0 errors + runs
      `5/0/9/-1/-1`, and exactly 2 errors; baselines unchanged except the two new
      rows, the test row graduating 1 err → 0 err). The gradient's showcase: ONE
      recursive binary search green under `proofs: [bounds, total]`, both
      obligations on one function — `bounds` on every read `xs[mid]` (guarded onto
      the sync interval floor), `total` on the halving measure. The window is a
      start `lo` and a length `span`; the left half recurses on `floor(span / 2)`,
      which over ℝ does NOT unit-decrease for `span ∈ [1, 2)` (`span/2 ∈ [0.5, 1)`,
      not ≤ `span − 1`). As built: `floor(e)` enters the **translatable fragment**
      (facts.ts `floorArg`, both bare `floor` and `Math.floor`), and smt.ts models
      it as a fresh **Int-sorted** const bracketed by `e − 1 < ⌊e⌋ ≤ e` — the same
      ToReal-wrapped Int trick as the `length` symbol. Integrality is the whole
      proof: on `span ∈ [1, 2)`, `⌊span/2⌋` is pinned to `0`, which IS ≤ `span − 1`
      — the termination analog of the bounds-soundness floor argument
      (`0 ≤ i < len ⟹ 0 ≤ ⌊i⌋ < len`). **terminates.ts is unchanged**: the existing
      "unit decrease over ℝ above a floor is finite" soundness covers a floored arg
      once the term is correctly Int-axiomatized. The `_bad` pins the limit — its
      `if span <= 0` (vs the green's `if span < 1`) leaves the `(0, 1)` gap live
      where `⌊span/2⌋ = 0 ≰ span − 1`, Z3 answering `span = 1/2`; plus a floored
      index with no upper bound (`span = 1, length(xs) = 0`). The same floor term
      serves `bounds`/`nonzero`/`arith`. Zero grammar changes, zero eval.ts changes.
      NO re-grade: type-core holds A+; this completes the no-new-surface half of the
      Phase A proof arc.
- [x] **`sortBy` infer/eval reconciliation (endgame A5)**: ✅ DONE (2026-06,
      `sortby_test`/`_bad` — 0 errors + runs `[1,3,5,7,9]` / `[9,7,5,3,1]` /
      `[5,3,1,7,9]` / `[apple,date,fig,pear]`, and exactly 3 errors). Closes the
      live divergence flagged in the SortedList box above: infer typed
      `sortBy(xs, keyFn)` (list-first, one-arg key) but eval read `args[0]` as a
      two-arg comparator and `args[1]` as the list — so EVERY type-checking call
      crashed at runtime. Reconciled onto the **key-fn form, fixing eval** (not
      infer): the real codebase convention is data-first, not the plan's assumed
      fn-first — `listMap`/`listFilter` are `(list, fn)` and chain under `|>`, so
      infer's signature was already right and eval was the outlier. eval now reads
      keys once (decorate–sort–undecorate), then a stable insertion sort by the
      extracted key; new `keyGt` orders num-or-string keys with the `<`/`>` rule
      (`cmpOp`). Green pins number AND string keys; `_bad` pins exactly 3 errors —
      the old comparator convention is a type error both ways (two-arg key fn;
      comparator-first order). Only `eval.ts` changed (latin1 edit, the non-UTF8
      byte at offset 3509 preserved); check baseline untouched, run baseline
      untouched except the two new rows. With this + A3 + A2 + A1's `Ok`-half, all
      four Phase-A-done criteria are met; A4 (may be cut) and A1's `let`-direct
      follow-on are the only in-arc remainder.
- [x] **Per-function proof scope (endgame A4, S1)**: ✅ DONE (2026-06,
      `proof_fnscope_test`/`_bad` — 0 errors + runs `20 5 3 10`, and exactly 5
      errors). A `proofs: [...]` clause at the head of a function body promises
      THAT def's obligations — the module need not declare them. Grammar:
      `optional($.proofs_decl)` added to the `function_def` block-body head,
      reusing the module-scope `proofs_decl` production verbatim (mirrors the
      module body head); regenerate is deterministic (identical parser.c), the
      change purely additive. Lowering: `lowerFnClause` pulls the clause out of
      the body, validates it through the same closed-vocabulary `lowerProofs`,
      and `lowerFnGroup` unions it onto `DFn.proofs` (a `total` member also sets
      `DFn.total`, so it routes through the totality engine unchanged). All four
      proof passes (`facts` bounds/nonzero/arith, `handled`) OR the per-function
      obligation into their in-scope test at each `DFn` — a sibling without the
      clause is unconstrained (`loose` does the read `get` proves, silent). The
      surface is a *trailing* clause, NOT the sketched `Proof [...] T` result
      brackets (those would overload the return-type surface); the set reads
      better as a clause, and the `effects: [...]` clause (S2) will share the
      shape. Per-block `@proof[…]{}` cut for now (OQ#3): module + per-function
      cover every fixture; block granularity would push the fact walkers below
      `DFn` granularity for no demonstrated need. The bounds/nonzero/arith/
      handled error suffixes were reworded "the module declares" → "declared
      via" (now accurate at either scope); check baseline = the two new rows +
      that one cosmetic reword, run baseline = the two new rows.
- [x] **`effects: [...]` clause sugar (endgame S2)**: ✅ DONE (2026-06,
      `effect_clause_test`/`_bad` — 0 errors + runs `width: 375` / `both: 42`,
      and exactly 3 errors). A body-head `effects: [...]` clause spells the
      concrete effect row as sugar for the inline `Effect [...] T` return
      wrapper. Grammar: new `effects_decl` production (the `proofs_decl` shape
      with the `effects` keyword — a literal-only keyword, extracted by
      `word: $.lower_id` exactly as `proofs`/`capabilities` are, so it stays
      usable as an identifier elsewhere), added to the `function_def` block-body
      head BEFORE `proofs_decl` (up-flowing effects, then down-flowing proofs —
      mirroring the module head's `capabilities:` then `proofs:`). Lowering:
      `lowerFnClause` collects the clause's capability names and UNIONS them
      with any inline `Effect [..]` row (`[...new Set([...inline, ...clause])]`),
      so the two forms may co-occur — the inline form stays because it alone can
      express an effect tail (`Effect [..e]`, the HOF case). No infer/checker
      change: the unioned row flows through the existing effect machinery
      identically (a body performs only what the row names; callers must cover
      it; the declared row propagates, as the `_bad` main→leak case shows).
      Regenerate deterministic; baselines = the two new rows only (no corpus
      file uses `effects` as an identifier — the keyword-extraction concern was
      empirically clean).
- [x] **Vocabulary + marker cleanup (endgame S3)**: ✅ DONE (2026-06,
      `vocab_cleanup_test`/`_bad` — 0 errors + runs `012 3`, and exactly 3
      errors). Three cleanups, no checker-pipeline restructure: (1) **`exhaustive`
      → always-on** — `exhaust.checkClauseHeads` drops the edition gate AND the
      `proofs: [exhaustive]` hardened flag and pushes a hard error
      unconditionally (match exhaustiveness was already always a hard error; this
      makes the multi-clause-head check match it). The word stays accepted in the
      proof vocabulary (declaring a true guarantee must not error — UX), it is
      just redundant now. (2) **inert decorators pruned** — a closed
      `KNOWN_DECORATORS = {low, kernel, total, private}` allowlist in
      `lowerDeclList`; an unknown decorator (`@deprecated`/`@idempotent`/
      `@audioKernel`) is now an error, not a silent no-op. (3) **`@total` is the
      function-scope shorthand** for `proofs: [total]` (S1) and stays a valid
      marker — no code change, it already routes through the totality engine.
      Verification cost was the reason this was safe: the corpus had ZERO
      clause-head warnings (the only two clause-head diags, in `clause_heads_bad`
      and `proof_scope_bad`, were already errors) and ZERO inert decorators, so
      both baselines = the two new rows only. `proof_scope_bad` stays at 5 errors
      (its dispatch gap now errors via the unconditional rule instead of the
      hardened path — same count, the message-path change is past the 80-char
      first-error slice). No grammar change.
- [x] **Construct-implied totality (endgame S4)**: ✅ DONE (2026-06,
      `implied_total_test`/`_bad` — 0 errors + runs `count 0`, and exactly 2
      errors). Pure structural roles get the §12.6 totality check from their
      position, no `@total` marker: (1) **refinement predicates** — a fn called
      in a `type T = Base where pred(value)` clause is added to `totalNames`
      (`collectPredicateFns` walks each `TBAlias` pred for callees that are
      `def`s), so its closure is forced total too (constEval already needed a
      total predicate to fold); (2) **store reducers** — each `messages` handler
      is synthesized as a one-clause DFn (`collectReducers`) and run through
      `checkFn` (no recursion ⇒ just the downward gate). Effectful roles
      (machine transitions, inputmap actions) stay governed by effects; game
      `update` deferred to Track C. **Corpus-safe by measurement**: every
      existing predicate fn is already `@total`/a builtin, and every existing
      reducer body is structural record/arith/total-builtin compute — confirmed
      by a full reducer-body sweep before writing a line. One latent bug
      surfaced and was fixed: `checkHofArg` assumed the fn at `args[0]`
      (fn-first), but the language is data-first (`filter(xs, f)`, same
      convention the A5 sortBy fix established) — `particle_system`'s
      `emitters |> filter(...)` reducers tripped it. Rewrote it to validate
      whichever argument is a function and ignore the data args; baseline went
      26→28→26 (the fix removed the two false positives), so both baselines =
      the two new rows only. No grammar change.
- [x] **Canvas free positioning + legibility proof (svg-legibility S0+S1)**:
      ✅ DONE (2026-06, SPEC §11.1.2, `canvas_legible_test`/`_bad`).
      `at=(x, y)` children (Canvas-parent-only; paint order = child order →
      position:relative/absolute html) + the static proof, opt-in via the
      `Legible` refinement: text disjointness, occlusion-from-above, and
      per-region APCA over composited solid fills (exact box bisection —
      a half-dark/half-light label is judged per region); unfoldable
      geometry is a could-not-prove error when the proof is active. The S0
      dig fixed a substrate bug: paren-form elements' indented children
      parsed as SIBLINGS (2026.6 views silently rendered only their last
      leaf) — dynamic precedence on the children-bearing element branch;
      zero corpus baseline changes. Residual: bare call children
      (`card()`) still siblings — spell `{card()}`. S2–S5 deferred.
- [x] **Call children (`card()` composition)**: ✅ DONE (2026-06, SPEC §11.1,
      `call_child_test`/`_bad`). The Canvas slice's last residual closed: a
      bare lowercase component call is a `child` grammar form
      (`call_child` — lowercase-headed, so it never competes with
      element_leaf's Upper paren form; lowers straight to a Call). Composed
      views nest for real; `theme_root_test` un-flattened (and its
      `action()` now paints the accent it proves against — the flattening
      had hidden that the proof surface was never painted). Guardrails
      proven position-independent: a typo'd component resolves-errors, args
      type-check, and an effectful component child in a pure view is the
      same §12.3 violation as anywhere — which is also why the baseline
      diff is EMPTY even for the new fixtures under the old parser
      (statements vs children hit identical checks). `{card()}` still
      parses.
- [x] **Effect-typed builtin surface**: ✅ DONE (2026-06, SPEC §12.5,
      `builtin_effects_test`/`_bad`). `setTheme`/`setViewport` charge
      `[ui]`, `externSource` + the prelude network names charge `[io]` —
      the stdlib stops lying by omission, including through S4c tails
      (`pmap(setViewport)` charges `[ui]` in a pure def). Decided ambient:
      `print`/`println` (observation channel) and `sleep` (virtual time).
      `theme_root_test`/`responsive_prop_test` mains now honestly declare
      `Effect [ui]`. Security re-graded A− → A (the named coverage gap).
- [x] **`Responsive(Length)` prop-only auto-collapse** (§3.1): ✅ DONE (2026-06).
      A `Length` prop accepts a `Breakpoint -> Length` value and collapses it against
      the live `viewport.breakpoint` — a second prop-site coercion exactly beside
      bare-number→`Px` (type-gated: return must be a `Length`). Collapsed eagerly at
      eval, *not* in the convergence pass (the viewport is a §9.1 read-only root → no
      (element,prop) edge). Added `setViewport` (the viewport sibling of `setTheme`) so
      a resize re-collapses every responsive prop. Fixtures `responsive_prop_test`
      (320px@Desktop → 100%@Mobile on swap) + `responsive_prop_bad` (2 type errors).
      Enables declare-once-reuse; responsive is now built end-to-end (styles §9.2–9.4).
- [x] **Accessibility-as-proof** (`OnSurface` contrast refinement, styles-design §14.1).
      ✅ DONE (conservative scope). `Color where contrast(value, surface) >= Lc` is enforced
      at compile time — an unreadable foreground/background pairing fails to check.
      As-built: APCA Lc in `constEval` (`contrast(fg,bg)`); the `Element` walk threads the
      resolved background (`surfaceBg`) down the tree (own literal `background` wins, else
      inherited); the `color` prop folds against it **only when the project defines
      `OnSurface`** (`PROP_SURFACE` opt-in, mirrors the §4.2 token-scale pattern) and both
      colour + background are constant hex. Error reports the computed Lc, never a proof
      obligation. Non-literal / convergence-resolved backgrounds stay silent (runtime /
      `uiModel` linter), per the §14.1 binding scope. Fixtures: `accessibility_test`
      (green), `accessibility_bad` (Lc 51 < 60, 1 intended error). Corpus impact zero
      (inert unless `OnSurface` is defined). No new logic-model concept — it is the
      existing refinement mechanism. **Remaining for an A− UI grade:** call-syntax phase 2
      (§2.1) + theme/responsive, not this.
- [x] **Unified numeric/dimension design note** (§3.4): **WRITTEN 2026-06**
      (`docs/numeric-dimension-design.md`, Phase B slice B1). Reconciles `Number` /
      `Duration` / `Px·Fr·Pct` / planned sized types into *one* dimensional algebra:
      `Number` is the dimensionless case, units are a new `United` type variant
      (refinement-flavored `type Meters = Number unit m`, NOT transparent to base —
      `m + s` errors; shape discipline, solver-invisible), sized types are range
      refinements over `Number` + an IR width tag (erase-on-JS / primitive-on-native),
      conversions are explicit-casts-only, literals default dimensionless and coerce
      via annotation (range-folded at check time). Pins B2 (units) and B3 (sized
      types + the 7th `overflow` obligation) as implementation, not redesign.
- [ ] *(optional)* `is Ok(a)` payload binding / flow-narrowing after `if x is Ok` —
      the terse "is this Ok and give me the value" sugar, replacing the dropped
      `user? a | b`.

## Track C — Large deferred builds (roadmap, not sequenced here)
Real, endorsed, but each is a major build and out of scope for the consistency pass.
- Games / interaction model: `@interaction` marker, capability-keyed dispatch,
  footprint = `mut` params (`interaction-model-design.md`).
- `frames` clock-stream host capability (blocks both the game loop and `animated`).
- `animated` modifier + motion-policy chokepoint (`animated-modifier-design.md`).
- Theme system (roles, `using`, `OnSurface` contrast) — `std/color` is built and has
  no consumer yet.
- `inputmap` — **core built 2026-06** (SPEC §10.5; `inputmap_test`/`_bad`):
  declaration + typed rows + conflict analysis + labels + drain-loop runtime;
  plus the `Inputmap` type + `help(map)` derived data
  (`inputmap_help_test`/`_bad`); plus `++` layering
  (`inputmap_layer_test`/`_bad`); plus chord-refinement literals
  (`inputmap_chord_test`/`_bad` — the literal-pattern refinement fold is
  general, not inputmap-only); plus `keymap` sugar (`keymap_test`/`_bad`).
  Remaining breadth (std `Key` device library + physical-key prefix,
  focus-zone scoping, the *rendered* overlay element, device libraries) stays
  Track C (`multitarget-design.md §4`).

## Cross-cutting discipline
- Every breaking step (Phase 2/3) = codemod + full `.velve` fixture + corpus run
  green before the next step. No silent caps — `log` anything a codemod skips.
- All breaks ride edition `2026.2`; prior-edition corpus must stay green throughout.
- Do **not** relitigate the Track A "don't change" set (`TODO.md §7`): four-primitive
  state taxonomy, transparent refinements, taint-at-parse, no-Maybe, motion-policy
  chokepoint, footprint=`mut`, Duration-as-dimension, indentation blocks.
