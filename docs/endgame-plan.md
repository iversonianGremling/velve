# Velve endgame plan — everything left, priced

*2026-06. Written to be self-contained for a reviewer who hasn't seen the rest
of the repo: read this top to bottom and you know what Velve is, what's done,
what's decided, what remains, in what order, and why.*

---

## 0. Context & ground rules

**Velve** is a tree-sitter grammar + TypeScript checker/interpreter for a
readable-by-default language with an opt-in proof gradient: HM inference,
refinement types, ADTs + exhaustiveness, effects-as-capabilities, sagas/
streams/machines/stores for state, an element DSL for UI, and a
`proofs: [...]` module obligation system discharged by a flow-sensitive fact
environment with a Z3 fall-through. Pipeline: `grammar.js → lower → resolve →
infer → exhaust → borrow → total → handled → facts → terminates → smt (async)
→ eval`. CLI: `node dist/index.js <check|run> <file.velve>` from `checker/`.

**The work cadence** (non-negotiable, inherited from the whole project): one
slice at a time, where a slice = (1) a green fixture — 0 check errors AND runs
with deterministic output; (2) a `_bad` twin with an exact expected error
count; (3) corpus baselines unchanged except the new rows (capture script
diffs check-error-counts and run-status for every fixture before/after);
(4) docs updated honestly (SPEC.md, TODO.md, PLAN.md,
docs/north-star-grades.md); (5) immediate commit with explicit path lists.
Grade rows re-grade only when a green fixture proves their named gap closed.

**Grades today** (north-star-grades.md §1): Type core **A+**, Error handling
**A+**, Security **A+**, Event/state **A**, UI/styling **A**, Low-level
**B−**, Games **C+/A−**, Animation **C/A**. The pattern: differentiators
nobody ships are built; what's owed is table-stakes breadth and the perf
substrate.

## 1. Decisions taken for this plan

These four were settled with the project owner (2026-06) and are inputs, not
open questions:

1. **Scope: everything priced.** Not just the designed board — the compiled
   backend is staged into milestones and the breadth tails are decomposed,
   accepting the estimates get rougher left to right.
2. **Sized types are range refinements, with a target-split.** On the JS
   target, `u8`/`i32`/… are check-time range refinements over `Number`
   (`u8 = Number where 0 <= value && value <= 255`) that **erase completely**
   at emit — `overflow` is a proof obligation, not a runtime behavior. The IR
   carries the width/signedness tag anyway, so a future native/WASM emitter
   lowers the same type to a real machine primitive. One surface, two
   representations, chosen per target.
3. **Backend: JS now, IR stays neutral.** Only the JS emitter gets built in
   this plan, but the IR bakes in no JS-isms (no implicit doubles-everywhere
   assumption beyond what `Number` already means, no DOM types in core IR,
   erasable judgments — units, refinements, error rows — dropped at lowering,
   not at parse).
4. **Ordering: finish the proof arc first** while the fact-env/Z3 machinery
   is warm; then numerics (worst grade); then infrastructure; backend phase
   after; breadth rides the backend.

---

## 2. Phase A — proof-arc completion (~6 slices)

The fact environment (`facts.ts`), Z3 back-end (`smt.ts`), and the
`proofs: [...]` vocabulary (`total bounds nonzero arith overflow exhaustive
handled`; **all 7 checkable as of 2026-06** — `arith` then `overflow` (B3(ii))
closed the set; `exhaustive` became always-on 2026-06, `vocab_cleanup_test`/`_bad` —
enforced regardless of declaration, the word kept for intent/back-compat) are
live. The Tier-1.5 relational witness
(`Index(length(xs))` dependent-refinement params: callers prove from path
facts, callees assume their signatures) just shipped. What's left in-arc:

- **A1. Witness gate spelling — binder seeding** *(1–2 slices)*. **FULLY
  SHIPPED 2026-06.** The `Ok`-payload half (`index_gate_test`/`_bad`): the
  Result gate `Result Index(length(xs)) e` carries the witness in return
  position — the callee proves each `Ok(payload)` in range (the gate can't
  lie), the caller seeds the `Ok`-binder of a `match`. **The `let`-direct half
  SHIPPED 2026-06** (`index_let_test`/`_bad`): a def returning a BARE
  `Index(length(xs))` (no `Result`, no Error escape hatch) is itself a gate —
  the tail-position guarantee check landed as `infer.tailExprs` (walk If/Match/
  Await/Do-block leaves) feeding `WITNESS_DEMANDS` over EVERY tail (the body is
  total, so each path must hand back an in-range index), and `bareWitnessRet`
  records the call in `WITNESS_RETURNS` so `facts.walkStmt` seeds the `let`
  binder — the `let` dual of the `match … | Ok(j)` seed in `walkBranch`. Both
  bridges pinned four ways in the `_bad` twin (construction overshoot, one tail
  unproven while its sibling proves, return relational pin, seed relational
  pin). Zero perturbation to the 193-row corpus. Original framing: Make
  `checkBounds(i, xs): Result(Index(length(xs)), :oob)` real: a dependent
  refinement in **return position** instantiates its `length(xs)` argument
  with the caller's actual binding, and the facts seed onto the binder —
  `let j = …` directly, and through `match … | Ok(j) ->` for the Result
  gate. Mechanism: infer records instantiated return-refinements per call
  site; facts.ts seeds match/let binders from them (needs pattern-binder
  type info or a side table keyed on AST nodes, same trick as
  `WITNESS_DEMANDS`). Mutation kills apply. If `let`-seeding and
  `Ok`-payload-seeding don't fit one slice, split exactly there.
- **A2. `arith` obligation** *(1 slice)*. **SHIPPED 2026-06**
  (`proof_arith_test`/`_bad`): the sixth vocabulary word — partial arithmetic
  domains, `sqrt(x)` needs `x >= 0`, `log/log2/log10` need `x > 0`,
  `asin/acos` need `-1 <= x <= 1`. Built exactly as predicted: a per-builtin
  domain table (`facts.ts ARITH_DOMAINS`) of one or two interval constraints,
  walked over both surface spellings (`Math.sqrt(x)` and bare `sqrt(x)`),
  discharged on the same floor + Z3 the other obligations already speak
  (`sqrt(a * a)` and `if a > b then log(a - b)` prove guard-free; out-of-domain
  model in the error). Scope-local. `proof_scope_bad`'s not-checkable pin moved
  `arith` → `overflow`, then B3(ii) retired it entirely. **Vocabulary 7/7 — complete.**
- **A3. Fractional-measure slice + binary-search showcase** *(1 slice)*.
  **SHIPPED 2026-06** (`proof_binsearch_test`/`_bad`): the floor-aware step
  turned out to need NO change to terminates.ts — the fix is to admit `floor(e)`
  into the translatable fragment (facts.ts `floorArg`) and model it in smt.ts as
  an Int-sorted term bracketed by `e − 1 < ⌊e⌋ ≤ e`, the same ToReal-wrapped Int
  trick as the `length` symbol. Integrality is what closes the gap: with
  `m = lo + floor(span/2)` the left half recurses on `⌊span/2⌋`, pinned to `0`
  for span ∈ [1, 2), which IS ≤ span − 1 — the existing "unit decrease over ℝ
  above a floor is finite" soundness covers it (no fractional-index detour
  needed; the indices stay integer because the recursion passes the floor). The
  showcase ships green under `proofs: [bounds, total]` on one function — `bounds`
  on the guarded read, `total` on the halving measure — and the floor term now
  serves `bounds`/`nonzero`/`arith` too. Original framing kept below.

  Probed during the SortedList arc: with `m = lo + span/2` the left-half
  measure fails over ℝ for span ∈ [1, 2); `m = lo + (span-1)/2` fixes the
  measure but leaves fractional indices. The slice: teach the
  `proof.terminates` measure translation a floor-aware step (the runtime
  floors indices; `0 ≤ i ∧ i < len ⟹ 0 ≤ ⌊i⌋ < len` is already the bounds
  soundness argument — the measure needs its analog), then ship the
  `bounds`+`terminates` binary search as the showcase fixture for the whole
  gradient.
- **A4. Finer proof scopes** *(1–2 slices)*. **PER-FUNCTION SHIPPED 2026-06**
  (`proof_fnscope_test`/`_bad`). The set-valued obligation list ships as a
  *trailing* `proofs: [...]` clause at the head of a function body (mirroring
  the module body head — the `proofs_decl` production reused verbatim), NOT the
  originally-sketched per-def `Proof [bounds] T` result brackets, which would
  have overloaded the return-type surface. Grammar change was purely additive
  (regenerate is deterministic — identical parser.c; corpus baselines held but
  for the two new rows + one cosmetic message reword). All four proof passes
  (`facts` bounds/nonzero/arith, `handled`) and the totality engine read the
  per-function obligation by OR-ing it into the in-scope test at each `DFn`; a
  sibling without the clause is unconstrained. **Per-block `@proof[...] { }`
  CUT for now** (OQ#3): the module + per-function scopes cover every fixture;
  block granularity would push the fact walkers below `DFn` granularity for no
  demonstrated need. **The sibling `effects: [...]` clause shipped alongside**
  (2026-06, `effect_clause_test`/`_bad`, SPEC §12.4): the same body-head shape
  for the up-flowing effect row, sugar for the inline `Effect [...] T` wrapper
  (rows union; the inline form stays for effect tails). So the function body
  head now mirrors the module body head exactly — `effects:` then `proofs:`,
  the duals of `capabilities:` then `proofs:`. **Construct-implied totality
  shipped too** (2026-06, `implied_total_test`/`_bad`, SPEC §12.6): pure
  structural roles — refinement predicates and store reducers — get the §12.6
  totality check from their position with no `@total` marker (predicates join
  `totalNames`; reducers are synthesized as one-clause DFns). Corpus-safe by a
  full sweep (every predicate fn is already `@total`/builtin, every reducer body
  is structural compute); the work also fixed `checkHofArg`'s stale fn-first
  assumption to the data-first convention. Game `update` is the third such role,
  deferred to Track C with the interaction model.
- **A5. `sortBy` infer/eval reconciliation** *(1 slice, small)*. **SHIPPED
  2026-06** (`sortby_test`/`_bad`). The divergence was total: infer typed
  `sortBy(xs, keyFn)` (list-first, one-arg key) while eval read `args[0]` as a
  two-arg comparator and `args[1]` as the list — so every type-checking call
  crashed at runtime. Reconciled onto the **key-fn form**, fixing the **eval**
  side: the actual codebase convention is data-first, not fn-first (`listMap`/
  `listFilter` are `(list, fn)` and chain under `|>`), so infer's signature was
  already right and consistent — eval was the outlier. eval now reads
  keys once up front (decorate–sort–undecorate), then a stable insertion sort by
  the extracted key; a new `keyGt` orders num-or-string keys with the same rule
  as the `<`/`>` operators (`cmpOp`). Green pins both number and string keys
  (identity/negated/distance, lexicographic); the `_bad` pins exactly 3 errors —
  the old comparator convention is now a type error in both ways (two-arg key fn;
  comparator-first arg order). NB: eval.ts contains a non-UTF8 byte — edited via a
  latin1 node script so offset 3509 is preserved byte-for-byte.

**Exit:** vocabulary 7/7 checkable as of B3(ii) (2026-06), the witness flow
complete in both positions, the showcase fixture exists, the one known
infer/eval divergence closed.

## 3. Phase B — numerics & low-level (~6 slices)

Low-level is the worst grade standing (**B−**). The north-star redefinition
(§5): the A+ axis is **units-of-measure as the general mechanism + sized
types**, not eight scattered numeric sketches.

- **B1. Unified numeric/dimension design note** *(1 slice, doc)*. **SHIPPED
  2026-06** (`docs/numeric-dimension-design.md`; the unchecked PLAN box is now
  checked). Settled, in writing, with the two reviewer-input decisions taken:
  `Number` stays the one runtime numeric on JS; sized types are range
  refinements over `Number` + an IR width tag (erase-on-JS /
  primitive-on-native); units are a **new `{ tag: "United", base, dims }` Type
  variant** — a check-time shape discipline the solver never sees (NOT
  transparent to base, so `m + s` errors), erased on every target. **Reviewer
  decisions:** (1) unit SYNTAX is refinement-flavored `type Meters = Number unit
  m` / `type Velocity = Number unit m/s` (over F#-style angle brackets — those
  collide with comparison/`Named`-args in the GLR grammar; over constructor-only,
  which gives no `m/s` composition); (2) conversions are **explicit-casts-only**
  (no silent coercion across dimension/width; literals default dimensionless and
  coerce into an annotated `Number`-based type, range-folded at check time). The
  note carries the rest-of-B slice plan (B2 i/ii/iii, B3 i/ii).
- **B2. Units of measure** *(2–3 slices)*. The algebra: `*`/`/` add/subtract
  exponent vectors, `+`/`-`/comparison require equal units, unitless
  literals coerce via constructors (`meters(5)`) or annotation. Pure
  infer-side judgment carried like `Refinement` (transparent? NO —
  units must NOT be transparent to base, unlike refinements: adding `m` to
  `s` must error. New `Type` variant `{ tag: "United", base, dims }`).
  Slice split: (i) algebra + decl surface + arithmetic rules; (ii)
  conversions, `Math.*` interplay (sqrt halves exponents), fixtures incl.
  the classic `ms*ms → Duration²` pin; (iii) std unit library if wanted.
  Erases at lowering (today: eval never sees types — free).
  - **B2(i) SHIPPED 2026-06** (`uom_test`/`uom_bad`, SPEC §2.15). The
    `{ tag: "United"; base; dims; name? }` variant landed with `dims` a
    normalized atom→exponent vector (the canonical identity — `m/s` ≡
    `Velocity`; the solver never sees it). Grammar: a `unit_clause` tail on a
    `Number` type alias (`type Velocity = Number unit m/s`), a flat
    signed-factor form (`m/s^2` → `[{m,1},{s,-2}]`), additive — corpus parser.c
    regenerates clean, zero baseline change but the two new rows. Algebra in
    `inferBinOp`: `*` adds / `/` subtracts exponents (a cancelled dimension
    collapses to bare `Number` — the `400ms/100ms` win generalized), `+`/`-`
    require `dimsEqual`, scaling by a scalar (`m * Number`) keeps the dimension.
    `unify` compares two `United` by dims and lets `United`-vs-base fall through
    to the mismatch error — that IS the explicit-casts-only rule (a `Number` is
    not a `Meters`). **Duration left untouched** (still a `Named` type, `ms*ms`
    still errors): folding it into the algebra so `ms*ms → Duration²` is the
    B2(ii) showcase. Deferred to a later slice with conversions: unit-value
    construction (constructors / literal-defaulting), so B2(i)'s fixture
    validates the compile-time algebra through unit-typed defs and runs on the
    erased (plain-`Number`) semantics.
  - **B2(ii) SHIPPED 2026-06** (`uom2_test`/`uom2_bad`, SPEC §2.15). **Duration
    folded into the algebra**: a `100ms` literal now *is* a `United{s:1}` value,
    so the `isDur` special-cases in `inferBinOp` deleted outright — `ms*ms : s^2`
    (the showcase pin, once an error), `400ms/100ms : Number`, `1/30s : s^-1` all
    fall out of the general `*`/`/` rules. **Math interplay**: a `unitMathCall`
    intercept on the `Math.*` builtins — `sqrt`/`cbrt` scale exponents (non-even
    → error), `abs`/`round`/`sign` preserve, `min`/`max`/`clamp` demand one shared
    dimension, transcendentals demand dimensionless; fires only when an argument
    is United, so plain-Number Math is byte-identical (baseline diff: only the two
    new rows). **Conversions**: the `Duration` stdlib module (`fromMs`/`fromSeconds`/
    `toMs`) retyped to the shared `United`, becoming the explicit Number↔Duration
    bridge (runtime identity). The *general* unit-value constructor /
    literal-defaulting surface (B2(iii) / design §5) shipped later as C1(v) once
    imports landed — see Phase C below; until then other units were params-only.
- **B3. Sized types + the `overflow` obligation** *(2 slices)*. (i) The
  stdlib range-refinement family (`u8 i8 u16 i16 u32 i32`) with gates
  (`u8(n): Result u8 String`) and closed ops — mirrors the
  refined-types library pattern exactly (gates / closed ops / faulting ops
  through the gate), plus the IR width tag spec'd in B1.
    - **B3(i) SHIPPED 2026-06** (`sized_test`/`sized_bad`). The family ships as
      a stdlib `where`-refinement library over `Number` (`type U8 = Number where
      0 <= value && value <= 255`, …) with the lowercase gate `u8(n): Result U8
      String` — exactly the refined-types pattern (gate is the only way in,
      faulting ops back through the gate, the always-succeeds widening cast still
      written), and so transparent to `Number`. Type names are `upper_id`, so the
      family is `U8`…`I32` / gates `u8`…`i32` (the same `Natural`/`natural` split;
      the idealized lowercase `u8` *type* from B1 §3.1 isn't grammatical, noted as
      built). The **IR width tag** is a name-derived `{ bits, signed }` on the
      `Refinement` type — inert at runtime, the Phase-D down payment and what
      `overflow` reads; its check-time teeth are the §4 no-coercion-across-widths
      rule (two *different* widths don't unify without an explicit cast, even
      though both are transparent to `Number`). The bounds family rides the
      existing compile-time literal fold (`takesU8(300)` is a check error). Pure
      add bar the width tag + the width-boundary unify branch (baseline diff: only
      the two new rows; the branch fires only when both sides carry a width, which
      no corpus file does). Still deferred to B3(ii): the `overflow` obligation.
  (ii) The seventh
  vocabulary word: under `proofs: [overflow]`, every arithmetic op whose
  operands carry a width must prove the result in range — same fact-env +
  Z3 pipeline as `bounds` (interval floor for literal/guarded cases, solver
  residue with the model in the error). **Vocabulary complete: 7/7.**
    - **B3(ii) SHIPPED 2026-06** (`proof_overflow_test`/`_bad`). Under
      `proofs: [overflow]` every `+`/`-`/`*` whose operands carry a width tag
      runs the SAME two-sided Z3 query as `bounds`, against the width range
      (unsigned `[0, 2^bits−1]`, signed `[−2^(bits−1), 2^(bits−1)−1]`) instead of
      a list length. Each width-carrying param **seeds** its range (`0 ≤ a ≤ 255`
      for `a: U8`, the assume side of the gate's guarantee), so a guarded op
      proves and the unguarded one reports the out-of-range model. As built: the
      width tag rides only ascribed PARAMS, so an operand is always a name — the
      result never folds to a constant, the proof is inherently relational, and
      the floor forwards every translatable result to Z3 (the B1 "interval floor
      for the literal case" is vacuous, noted as built). Width is lost on
      intermediate results (`(a+b)+c` checks only the inner op — Phase D's native
      lowering propagates it); div / unary-minus INT_MIN corner deferred. The
      lower.ts not-yet-checkable guard is now a forward safety net only (all 7
      checkable). Baseline diff: the two new fixtures, plus the two anticipated
      re-pins (`proof_scope_bad`/`proof_fnscope_bad` — which the fixture comments
      *predicted*, "this pin was bounds, then arith, …" — flipped from the
      not-checkable error to a REAL overflow, each held at its 5-error count).

**Exit:** Low-level re-grades B− → **A−** by the row's own definition (the
two named mechanisms shipped; the held-back + is the native representation,
Phase D's neutral IR being the down payment). The proof vocabulary closes.

---

## 4. Phase C — infrastructure (~4 slices)

- **C1. Multi-file imports (SPEC §7.3)** *(2–3 slices)*. The biggest
  non-backend infrastructure gap: the refined-type/SortedList libraries
  travel by copy-paste inclusion today.
  - **(i) Resolution + check — DONE 2026-06** (`loader.ts`,
    `import_refined_test`/`import_private_bad`/`import_refined_lib`). A loader
    parses+lowers the entry file and every `./`/`../` module it imports
    transitively, merging their decls into ONE program (imported-first, deduped
    by abspath, cycles rejected). **As-built — the merge does all the work:** a
    `module Foo { … }` in the merged decl list is exactly what a single-file
    program already produces, so resolve/infer/exhaust/eval run *unchanged* —
    the registries (REFINEMENTS, FN_PARAMS, ADT_CTORS) become per-program for
    free, and `@private` ctors stay sealed across files via the existing
    `privateTo`/moduleStack check (the `_bad` proves it: a forged ctor outside
    its file goes from "unresolved" pre-loader to "private to module"
    post-loader). The file-local `DImport` is marked `local` so resolve/infer/
    eval skip its placeholder binding. *Honest:* the green consumer's *check*
    passes pre-loader too (lenient `Unknown` for unknown imports/types), so the
    behavioral proof is `run` (pre-loader dies `undefined variable: natural`).
  - **(i) rider — unresolved imports are errors — DONE 2026-06**
    (`import_unresolved_bad`/`import_foreign_test`). Closes the honesty gap
    above: a path that resolves to no stdlib module, no file, and isn't a foreign
    `import js` is now a hard error ("cannot resolve import"), and a braced named
    import of a missing export is "module 'M' has no export 'x'" — rather than
    binding the name to `Unknown` and type-checking clean. Invariant: `Unknown`
    is the post-diagnostic recovery type, minted only after an error (the one
    exception, `import js` foreign interop, is opaque by design). Side benefit:
    `import_refined_test`'s *check* now depends on the loader too. Two small
    AST flags (`foreign`, `named`) carry the brace/`js` info lowering discarded.
  - **(ii) eval loading + CLI multi-file entry — DONE 2026-06**
    (`import_diamond_test` + `diamond_{base,a,b}`; `import_cycle_{a,b}_bad`). It
    largely fell out of (i) — `run` already drives the merged program — but the
    fixtures earned their keep: the diamond (entry → {a,b,base}; a→base; b→base)
    proves transitive eval loading + single-merge dedup (runs `12/7/20` across
    four files), and the cyclic pair proves the DAG guard. Writing them found a
    real bug: the entry path was its own `onStack`/`loaded` key verbatim
    (relative) while deps resolve to absolute paths, so a cycle back through the
    entry double-merged it; fixed by normalizing the entry to absolute.
  - **(iii) `std/` on disk + corpus off inclusion — DONE 2026-06**
    (`std/refined`, `std/sorted`; `refined_types_test`/`sorted_list_test`
    migrated; `import_std_bad`). A `std/X` path now resolves to a compiler-shipped
    source file (`checker/std/X.velve`, located relative to the loader so it is
    cwd-independent) and merges exactly like a `./` import. The §3.3 refined-type
    library and §3.2 SortedList live on disk **once each** and the two corpus
    fixtures `import` them rather than inlining the module — same `run` output,
    proof moved to the standalone std files (baseline now globs `checker/std`).
    Resolution is **additive**: a `std/X` is intercepted only if its source exists,
    so ambient `std/json`/`std/set`/`Math` fall through untouched and a typo'd
    `std/X` still errors "cannot resolve" (`import_std_bad`) — not swallowed.
    Phase-C exit met: a green fixture imports `std/refined` (not includes it),
    baselines hold.
  - **(iv) selective visibility — DONE 2026-06**
    (`import_selective_test`/`import_selective_bad`/`import_selective_std_bad`;
    local `selective_lib`). A braced `import { a, b } from "./M"` now brings in
    **exactly** `a` and `b`: the loader records the asked-for names per dependency
    file and the resolver seals every *other* fn/value member of the merged module
    `privateTo` it — reusing the very `privateTo`/`moduleStack` use-check that seals
    `@private` ctors (the only new wording is the fn/value branch of the message).
    Internal cross-references survive (the module is on the stack when its own
    bodies resolve — `quadruple` keeps calling the unexported `secretDouble`), and
    type **names** stay public (so `refined_types_test` writes `Result Natural
    String` un-imported). Escape hatches: a bare (namespace) import seals nothing,
    and any file touched by a bare import is left fully visible. Honest limit: the
    exported surface is the **union** across a file's braced importers — true
    per-file scoping waits on qualified module access. Baseline 225→229, 0 CRASH,
    the whole pre-existing corpus byte-identical (the migrated consumers stay
    clean — they imported every member they use).
  - **(v) DONE 2026-06** (`units_lib_test`/`units_lib_bad`; `checker/std/units.velve`):
    the deferred B2(iii) general unit constructor, shipped now that imports land.
    **The one new primitive is literal defaulting** (numeric-dimension §5): a
    compile-time-CONSTANT number takes the unit its annotation names, at every
    `let`-ascription site (`literalDefaultsToUnit`, guarded by `constEval` → a
    non-constant `Number` still errors, explicit-casts-only §4). On that keystone
    `std/units` is pure Velve: `let oneMeter: Meters = 1` is the one defaulting
    site per dimension, every constructor/extractor is the `*`/`/` algebra
    (`meters(n)=n*oneMeter`, `inMeters(d)=d/oneMeter`). Ships SI base + derived
    (`Velocity`/`Acceleration`/`Area`/`Force`) with constructors, extractors, and
    derived relations (`speed`/`rate`/`force`) whose dimension is computed and
    checked; green runs 42/10/5/350. Baseline 229→232, 0 CRASH, pre-existing
    corpus byte-identical. NOT a re-grade — Low-level already moved B−→A− at
    B3(ii); the held-back `+` is Phase D native IR.
  - **(vi) LSP support — DONE 2026-06** (`scripts/lsp_smoke.mjs`; `src/lsp.ts`
    made loader-aware + testable). The LSP server already existed (diagnostics /
    hover / go-to-definition / completion / semantic tokens) but **bypassed the
    loader** — it lowered the open buffer directly, so the entire C1 import
    machinery was dead in-editor. Closed by routing analysis through
    `loadProgram(file, openDocs)`: a new optional `openDocs` map (abspath → live
    text) lets the open — possibly unsaved, possibly diskless — buffer override
    disk while every imported file still loads normally, so an `import` resolves
    its transitive cone in the editor exactly as the CLI does. Also: `findExprAt`
    gained a `source` filter (the merged module now holds imported decls — a
    cursor position must not match an identically-placed expr in another file);
    go-to-definition returns the binding's true file (`span.source`) so jumps
    **cross files** into a library; diagnostics are scoped to the open file
    (`span.source === abs`, so a library's errors don't smear onto the importer);
    and the LSP now surfaces the `arith`/`overflow` floors B2/B3 added, alongside
    the existing nonzero/bounds floors (all conservative — the CLI's Z3 verdict is
    authoritative). The server's query logic was extracted into exported pure
    functions behind a main-module guard, so `scripts/lsp_smoke.mjs` drives it
    headless (8 checks incl. cross-file definition into `std/units`); a real stdio
    `initialize` handshake confirms the server still launches. Baseline 232→232
    (LSP isn't a `.velve` fixture; the loader/find edits are optional-param-guarded
    so the CLI path is byte-identical — stash-rebuild-diff EMPTY), 0 CRASH. Honest
    gaps left (design §9): no lazy per-symbol queries / debounce / incremental cache
    yet — a `didChange` re-analyzes the whole open program. NOT a graded north-star
    row (the board tracks language design, not tooling) → no re-grade.
    *C1 complete.*
- **C2. `is Ok(a)` payload binding / flow narrowing — DONE 2026-06**
  (`is_narrow_test`/`is_narrow_bad`). `if x is Ok(a)` binds the payload in
  the then-branch (and **only** there — a leak into else/after is an
  unresolved name), reusing `checkPat`/`matchPat`/`bindPat` end-to-end; the
  new surface is one AST field (`TypeTest.binder`) threaded through
  lower/resolve/infer/eval/facts. The promised synergy landed: the `Ok`-binder
  of a return-gate carries the witness facts, so `if checkBounds(xs,i) is
  Ok(j)` licenses `xs[j]` with no guard — the `if`-dual of A1's `match … |
  Ok(j) ->` seed. Grammar cost (the glued `(` races `call`) resolved with a
  `postfix`+dynamic-precedence binder alternative and declared conflicts; the
  no-binder `is` test parses identically (pre-existing corpus byte-identical
  through the regen). NOT a graded row → no re-grade.
- **C3. Convergence-cycle pre-flag — CUT 2026-06** (decision, not a slice).
  A static pre-flag would *duplicate a check that already exists and is
  strictly better placed.* The runtime `converge()` (eval.ts) resolves prop
  references in topological order over the concrete **(element instance, prop)**
  graph and rejects any cycle with the offending edge named —
  `converge_bad` pins it: *"convergence cycle: 'width' on Box and Box reference
  each other."* That precision is only possible with the real tree. A static
  analysis lacks it, so it would be **approximate in both directions**:
  false-positives on legal cross-element references (a `next.P`/`prev.P` chain
  whose cycle the actual sibling count breaks), false-negatives on
  tree-dependent cycles. And `converge_bad` is exactly such a tree-dependent
  cross-element cycle — the motivating-fixture test the recommendation set comes
  back empty. So the unchecked box is closed by *deciding*: the sound home for
  this fault is the runtime pass, and it is already there and tested.

**Exit — MET 2026-06.** Libraries are real artifacts (refined / SortedList /
units all imported, not included); the editor is loader-aware; flow narrowing
binds payloads. With C1 complete, C2 done, and C3 cut, **Phase C is closed.**
The designed board (north-star §9's "live design choices") is fully closed
except the backend.

---

## 5. Phase D — the compiled backend (a phase, not slices; ~20–30 slice-equivalents)

100% gate for Games and Animation, the perf ceiling under UI. Design note
exists (`compiler-architecture-design.md`).

- **D0. IR design — DONE 2026-06** (doc; `compiler-architecture-design.md` §11).
  Revised the note against Decisions 2–3: a **fresh distinct Velve Core IR** of
  ~13 nodes in **ANF** (resolving the fresh-vs-annotated DECIDE), with effects as
  a single explicit `Perform { cap, op }` node and **generators demoted to a JS
  *emitter* choice, not an IR primitive** (resolving OQ#4 — a generator node would
  bake a JS-ism into the neutral middle, violating Decision 3). The **erasure law**
  is stated and proved: units, refinement predicates, error rows, effect rows,
  taint, totality all discharge at the AST→IR frontier and are absent below it —
  the **width tag is the single survivor** (a representation choice deferred to the
  backend: dropped on JS, read by native/WASM), the concrete face of Decision 2's
  "one surface, two representations". Soundness is not asserted but *witnessed* —
  the runtime `Value` union (`value.ts`) already has no member for a unit /
  refinement / width / row, so eval is the existing proof that the frontier is real;
  §11 just formalizes for the compiled path the erasure eval does for free. §11.4
  tabulates the desugaring (40+ AST forms → the 13), §11.6 anchors every surviving
  node to its `Value` counterpart (so compiled output is differential-testable),
  §11.7 freezes the contract D1 builds against. Hashing granularity DECIDED
  per-symbol. No code, no fixtures (a doc slice, like B1); SPEC untouched (the IR is
  compiler-internal, not language surface); no graded row moves (planning, not a
  shipped capability).

- **D1. IR + compute-core JS emitter** *(5–8)*. Fns, ADTs, match
  compilation, lists/records/closures, the pure builtin surface. The
  existing corpus is the differential test suite: every fixture runs under
  eval AND compiled, outputs diffed — the baseline script generalizes to a
  three-column capture (check / run-eval / run-compiled). eval.ts becomes
  the reference semantics, never deleted.
  - **D1(i) — the compute spine — DONE 2026-06.** First real backend code:
    `core.ts` (the §11.3 IR datatypes + AST→Core **ANF** lowering for the pure
    spine — single-clause defs, `Lit`/`Var`, arithmetic/comparison/equality
    `PrimOp`s, saturated `Call` to a def or a whitelisted pure builtin, tail-`if`
    incl. else-if ladders, `Do` blocks), `emitjs.ts` (Core→JS, `$show` mirroring
    `display`, the operator table mirroring `evalBinOp`), the `compile`/`runc` CLI
    commands, and **`scripts/diff.mjs` — the three-column differential harness**.
    Anything outside the spine is refused **loudly** via `CompileUnsupported`
    (exit 2 → harness reports `unsupported`), never a silent miscompile — the
    backend-slice analogue of a `_bad` twin (no new *checker* rejection rule, so
    the guarantee is "refuse, never lie", asserted by the harness). Green fixture
    `compile_spine_test.velve` (fib/fact/gcd + grade ladder) compiles to JS that
    prints **byte-identically** to eval; frontier twin `compile_frontier_test.velve`
    (a valid `match`) is refused cleanly. Harness over the whole corpus: **15 match,
    0 mismatch, 0 js-crash**, 116 unsupported (the honest frontier). The erasure law
    is now *empirically* witnessed, not just argued: among the 15 matches are
    `uom_test`/`std/units` (units), `refinement_compile_test`/`std/refined`
    (refinements), and `proof_terminates_test` (totality) — source carrying those
    judgments compiles to JS that drops every one and computes identically. SPEC
    untouched (a compiled path observationally identical to eval is not a surface
    change); no graded row moves yet (the backend is partial — `Match`, heap values,
    and `Perform` remain).
  - **D1(ii) — scalar `match` compiles — DONE 2026-06.** `Match` does **not** survive
    into the IR: it is lowered *here* to the `If`/`Let` decision-spine (classic match
    compilation), so the backend never grows a pattern-matching node. The subject is
    named once; branches compile back-to-front into nested `If`s terminating in a new
    `Fail` node (the non-exhaustive fall-through — a hard `throw`, unreachable on
    check-passing programs by the `exhaust` pass, so the harness never exercises it).
    Scope of this slice: the **scalar** patterns — `PWild`/`PVar`/`PTyped` (irrefutable,
    maybe bind) and `PLit` (an `==` test mirroring eval's strict `v === lit.value`) —
    plus guards (`| n if g`). One subtlety paid down: `match n | n -> …` rebinds the
    subject to its own name, and the naïve `const n = n` is a JS TDZ crash; the identity
    rebind is detected and skipped (eval gets this free via env children). **Honest
    slice split**: D1(i)'s doc folded all of `Match` + heap values into one "D1(ii)";
    as built, scalar `match` shipped alone (control flow, no new value kinds) and the
    heap-value core slid to **D1(iii)**. Green fixture `compile_match_test.velve`
    (literal/binder/guard arms over Number/Bool/String) compiles **byte-identically**
    to eval; the frontier twin `compile_frontier_test.velve` was repointed from scalar
    `match` (now compiling) to **constructor destructuring** (`Ok(v)`/`Error(e)`) — the
    new edge — and is refused cleanly (`unsupported`, exit 2). Harness: **16 match, 0
    mismatch, 0 js-crash**, 116 unsupported. SPEC untouched; no graded row moves (still
    partial). Next: **D1(iii)** = ADT `Ctor`s + constructor/tuple/record patterns +
    lists/records/tuples + closures (the heap-value core), still pre-effect.
  - **D1(iii) — tuples compile (the heap-value core opens) — DONE 2026-06.** The first
    HEAP value to clear all three differential columns. A tuple is the thinnest cut of
    the core: positional, fixed-arity, **no `type` decl and no constructor-name
    resolution** (unlike Ctors). Two new IR computations — `Tuple` (build from atoms)
    and `Proj` (read element *i*) — and one new runtime convention: heap values carry a
    `$t` tag (`$tuple(...) → {$t:"T", es}`) so the JS `$show` reproduces value.ts
    `display`'s `(a, b)` form exactly. The scalar pattern compiler was generalized to a
    flat `MatchStep[]` (ordered binds + truthy-tests) so a `PTuple` projects each slot
    and **recurses** — nested tuples and literal/var sub-patterns with fall-through all
    fold into the same `If`/`Let` spine. Tuple shape itself is no test (arity is
    type-guaranteed). Green fixture `compile_tuple_test.velve` (construct/return,
    construct+destructure, literal sub-patterns that fall through, a nested
    `((a,b),c)` pattern, and guards over bound elements) compiles **byte-identically**
    to eval across 10 lines. Known tradeoff: back-to-front folding duplicates the
    fall-through tail per branch (naive decision tree) — correct, differentially
    verified; join-point sharing is a later optimization, not a correctness matter.
    **Honest slice split (again)**: D1(iii) was forecast as the *whole* heap-value core;
    as built, **tuples shipped alone** (the thinnest verifiable aggregate) and ctors/
    records/lists/closures slid forward. The frontier twin `compile_frontier_test.velve`
    (constructor destructuring) is unchanged — still refused cleanly (exit 2); it flips
    when ADT ctors land. Still TAIL-position match only; destructuring `let`/params stay
    at the frontier. Harness: **17 match, 0 mismatch, 0 js-crash**, 116 unsupported (238
    files). SPEC untouched; no graded row moves (still partial). Next: **D1(iv)** = ADT
    `Ctor`s + constructor patterns (flips the frontier twin), then records, lists,
    closures — still pre-effect.
  - **D1(iv) — ADT constructors compile (the frontier twin flips) — DONE 2026-06.** The
    slice D1(iii)'s guardrail was waiting on. Constructors are now BUILT — applied
    (`Circle(2)`, `Ok(5)`) or nullary (`Point`, `None`) — and DESTRUCTURED in `match`
    arms via `PCtor`, including **nested** ctor patterns and a ctor wrapping a tuple
    payload (`Error(Rect((w, h)))`). One new runtime convention reuses the `$t` tagging
    scheme tuples introduced: `$ctor(name, payload) → {$t:"C", name, payload}` (nullary
    ⇒ payload `null`), so `$show` reproduces value.ts VCtor display exactly — `Name(x)`
    for a payload variant, bare `Name` for a nullary one. Three IR computations: `Ctor`
    (build), `CtorName` (read the tag — the match test rides an existing `==` PrimOp),
    `CtorPayload` (read to bind/recurse). A `PCtor` discriminates on the tag, then (if
    it names a payload) projects it and **recurses** into the same `MatchStep[]` spine
    tuples generalized — arity is type-guaranteed, so the tag test is the whole
    refutation (eval's redundant payload-presence checks are elided on check-passing
    programs). Supported ctor names = the module's own `type … = | …` variants plus the
    prelude data ctors eval defines globally (Ok/Error/Some/None); a unary ctor used
    unapplied is refused as a first-class function. Green fixture
    `compile_ctor_test.velve` (a user `Shape` ADT + built-in Result/Option, nullary +
    payload variants, value display, nested patterns, tuple-in-ctor, a payload guard)
    compiles **byte-identically** to eval across 12 lines. The frontier twin
    `compile_frontier_test.velve` was rewritten to build a **record** (`#{ x, y }`) — the
    next unrepresented heap value — and still refuses cleanly (exit 2). **Honest baseline
    movement**: enabling ctors also flipped the pre-existing corpus file
    `ctor_pattern_test.velve` from `unsupported` to `match` (a real ctor-pattern program
    now runs compiled, byte-identical to eval) — not a regression, the feature landing.
    Harness: **19 match, 0 mismatch, 0 js-crash**, 115 unsupported (239 files). SPEC
    untouched; no graded row moves (still partial). Next: **D1(v)** = records (build +
    field read + `PRecord`), then lists, then closures-as-values — still pre-effect.
  - **D1(v) — records compile (the frontier twin flips again) — DONE 2026-06.** The
    value D1(iv)'s guardrail was holding. Records are now BUILT — `#{ x: a, y: b }`,
    including `...spread` — FIELD-READ (`p.x`), and DESTRUCTURED in `match` via
    `PRecord`. One new runtime convention extends the `$t` scheme: `$record(fs) →
    {$t:"R", fs}` where `fs` is a plain JS object whose key-insertion order IS the
    display order, so `$show` reproduces value.ts VRecord display exactly — `{ k: v, … }`
    in insertion order, the empty record as `{  }`. The order subtlety is load-bearing:
    eval builds a `Map` (spread fields first, then explicit; an explicit key shadowing a
    spread key updates **in place**, keeping its slot), and JS `{ ...base.fs, k: v }` has
    exactly those semantics — so a spread+overwrite (`#{ ...p, y: 99 }`) displays its
    fields in the original order. Two IR computations: `Record` (build, optional spread
    atom + ordered explicit fields) and `Field` (read a named field). `PRecord` is pure
    projection like `PTuple` — no shape test, since the checker guarantees the subject is
    a record carrying the named fields; the grammar's `record_pattern` is shorthand-only
    (`{ x, y }`), so each field binds a `PVar`. Green fixture `compile_record_test.velve`
    (build, field-read, spread+overwrite, a `PRecord` arm with a guard reading a bound
    field, and a record field holding a ctor read via `.tag` then matched) compiles
    **byte-identically** to eval across 9 lines. The frontier twin
    `compile_frontier_test.velve` was rolled to build a **list** (`[1, 2, 3]`) — the next
    unrepresented heap value — and still refuses cleanly (exit 2). Unlike D1(iv), **no**
    pre-existing corpus file flipped: the only new green is the fixture itself (the `&&`
    in an earlier draft of the guard was the short-circuit-operator frontier, not records
    — split into a nested `if` to keep the slice honest). Harness: **20 match, 0 mismatch,
    0 js-crash**, 115 unsupported (240 files). SPEC untouched; no graded row moves (still
    partial). Next: **D1(vi)** = lists (build + index/length + `PList`), then
    closures-as-values, then destructuring `let`/params — still pre-effect.
  - **D1(vi) — lists compile (the frontier twin flips again) — DONE 2026-06.** The
    value D1(v)'s guardrail was holding. Lists are now BUILT — `[a, b, …]`, including
    the empty `[]` — ELEMENT-READ (`xs[i]`), and MEASURED (`length`/`isEmpty`). One
    runtime convention extends the `$t` scheme: `$list(...es) → {$t:"L", es}`, an array
    tagged so `$show` reproduces value.ts VList display exactly — `[a, b, …]`, empty as
    `[]`, each element shown by the same `$show` so a list OF heap values nests (e.g.
    `[(1, 2), (3, 4)]`). Two IR computations: `List` (build — each element an atom) and
    `Index` (read element `i` — `.es[i]`). `length`/`isEmpty` join the pure-builtin
    whitelist: `length` mirrors eval (a list's element count or a string's char count),
    `isEmpty` is `length == 0`. eval bounds-checks `xs[i]` at runtime (OOB is an
    eval-error in BOTH columns, never a miscompile); valid programs read in-bounds, so
    the column is byte-identical. (Velve has no list PATTERN — `PList` does not exist in
    the grammar — so destructuring is by index/builtin, not by arm; that part of the
    forecast was a mis-recollection, corrected here.) Green fixture
    `compile_list_test.velve` (build, empty list, element-read at literal/computed index,
    `length`, `isEmpty` on full and empty, a list of tuples, a list literal indexed
    inline) compiles **byte-identically** to eval across 9 lines. The frontier twin
    `compile_frontier_test.velve` was rolled to bind a **closure** (`fn x -> x + 1`) and
    call it — the next unrepresented value — and still refuses cleanly (exit 2). Unlike
    D1(v), an honest baseline movement: **one** pre-existing corpus file flipped,
    `dependent_test.velve` — a dependently-typed program (`InBounds(length(xs))`,
    `NonEmpty(a)`) whose refinement/dependent machinery erases upstream (the erasure
    law), leaving exactly the list build + index + length spine the compiler now lowers;
    it now compiles byte-identically (`a=10 b=30 c=1 d=5`). Harness: **22 match, 0
    mismatch, 0 js-crash**, 114 unsupported (241 files) — +2 match (fixture + the flip),
    −1 unsupported (the flip left; the frontier stayed unsupported, rolling list→closure).
    SPEC untouched; no graded row moves (still partial). Next: **D1(vii)** =
    closures-as-values (lambda lowering + capture), then destructuring `let`/params —
    still pre-effect.
  - **D1(vii) — closures compile (the frontier twin flips again) — DONE 2026-06.** The
    value D1(vi)'s guardrail was holding. Closures are now FIRST-CLASS: a `fn x -> …`
    lowers to a JS arrow function that closes over its enclosing `const`s by lexical
    scope, exactly as eval's single-clause VFn closes over its captured `env` — so no
    explicit capture list is computed, the names just resolve outward. A closure is
    BOUND by `let`, RETURNED from a `def` (capturing that def's param — `def adder(n)
    -> fn x -> x + n`), PASSED as an argument, written INLINE at a call site, CALLED
    through a local name, and DISPLAYED `<fn:<lambda>>` (value.ts's VFn display). One IR
    computation, `Lambda` (params + a body that lowers in TAIL position with the params
    in scope); no runtime `$t` tag — the arrow is callable directly, and `$show` maps any
    `typeof === "function"` to `<fn:<lambda>>` (the only functions reaching `$show` are
    lowered lambdas; user `def`s are never first-class values on the pure spine yet). The
    `Call` guard gained one clause: a name in local scope is a closure value, called with
    the identical `fn(args)` syntax — JS lexical scope makes a local correctly shadow a
    same-named def/builtin, as eval's binding lookup does. A free name in a lambda body
    (a self-referential `let f = fn … -> f(…)`) is out of scope here exactly as it is
    absent from eval's capture env, so it refuses identically rather than miscompiling.
    Green fixture `compile_closure_test.velve` (let-bound lambda, returned closure with
    capture, closure-as-argument, inline lambda, printed closure) compiles
    **byte-identically** to eval across 5 lines (`6 / 17 / 101 / 42 / <fn:<lambda>>`). The
    frontier twin `compile_frontier_test.velve` was rolled to a **first-class `def`
    reference** (`let f = double` — naming a def without calling it; eval has it for free
    as a VFn in the env, the compiler refuses it as a free variable) — the next
    unrepresented value — and still refuses cleanly (exit 2). (Destructuring `let`/params
    from the prior forecast are SYNTAX errors — neither exists in the grammar, like
    `PList` before them — so the frontier rolled to def references instead; the
    mis-recollection is corrected here.) Harness: **23 match, 0 mismatch, 0 js-crash**,
    114 unsupported (242 files) — +1 match (the fixture), unsupported unchanged (no corpus
    flip; the frontier stayed unsupported, rolling closure→def-reference). SPEC untouched;
    no graded row moves (still partial). Next: **D1(viii)** = first-class `def` references
    (eta-expansion of a named function to a value) — still pre-effect.
  - **D1(viii) — first-class `def` references compile (the frontier twin flips again) —
    DONE 2026-06.** The value D1(vii)'s guardrail was holding. A named `def` mentioned
    without calling it is now a VALUE: eval has it for free (a top-level def is a VFn in
    the environment), and the compiled def is a hoisted JS `function` — itself a value —
    so the reference lowers to a bare `Var` atom naming it, NO eta-expansion wrapper and
    no capture needed (the JS-backend shortcut the design note flagged; a native backend
    would eta-expand to a closure instead). It is then bound by `let`, passed to a
    higher-order function, returned from a `def` (both branches of an `if` being def
    references), and called like any closure. **The display had to become faithful:** eval
    shows a named function as `<fn:name>` but a lambda as `<fn:<lambda>>`, so `$show` (which
    had hard-coded `<fn:<lambda>>` for every function since D1(vii)) now reads the JS
    function's own `.name` — empty ⇒ `<lambda>`, set ⇒ the def's name. To keep lambdas
    anonymous (a let-bound arrow would otherwise inherit its binding's name, JS name
    inference) every lambda is wrapped in an identity `$lam(…)` so it sits in argument
    position and JS infers no `.name`. Two lowering touch-points: a `userFns` branch in the
    `Var` normalizer (and a `norm` fast-path so a def reference is an atom, not a redundant
    `Let` temp). Green fixture `compile_defref_test.velve` (def let-bound and called, def
    passed to a HOF, def returned from a def, def printed) compiles **byte-identically** to
    eval (`10 / 42 / 30 / 12 / <fn:double>`). The frontier twin `compile_frontier_test.velve`
    was rolled to name a **builtin** as a value (`let f = abs` — eval has it as a VBuiltin,
    the compiler's first-class path admits user defs only, so it refuses `abs` as a free
    variable) — the next unrepresented value — and still refuses cleanly (exit 2). No
    pre-existing corpus file flipped (`fn_type_test` passes defs as values too but also uses
    string interpolation, so it stays unsupported). Harness: **24 match, 0 mismatch, 0
    js-crash**, 114 unsupported (243 files) — +1 match (the fixture), unsupported unchanged.
    SPEC untouched; no graded row moves (still partial). Next: **D1(ix)** = first-class
    BUILTIN references (the same value-ification for the prelude functions) — still
    pre-effect.
  - **D1(ix) — first-class BUILTIN references compile (the frontier twin flips again) —
    DONE 2026-06.** The value D1(viii)'s guardrail was holding. A whitelisted builtin
    mentioned without calling it is now a value, exactly as a user `def` is: eval has it
    as a VBuiltin in the environment, the compiled builtin is an inlined prelude `const`
    (itself a value), so the reference lowers to a bare `Var` atom naming it. The lowering
    is a two-line echo of D1(viii) — a `BUILTINS` branch in the `Var` normalizer and the
    `norm` fast-path. **One display trap had to be paid down:** `$show` reads a function's
    `.name`, and every prelude impl's const already carries its Velve name EXCEPT `int`,
    whose impl was the bare native `Math.trunc` (`.name === "trunc"`). A printed `int`
    reference would have shown `<fn:trunc>` against eval's `<fn:int>`, so the impl is now
    wrapped `(x) => Math.trunc(x)` — an assigned arrow whose const infers `.name === "int"`
    — behaviourally identical for the call sites, faithful for the value. Green fixture
    `compile_builtinref_test.velve` (builtin let-bound and called, builtin passed to a HOF,
    `abs`/`int`/`floor` printed) compiles **byte-identically** to eval (`9 / 4 / 7 /
    <fn:abs> / <fn:int> / <fn:floor>`). The frontier twin `compile_frontier_test.velve` was
    rolled to a **short-circuit `&&`** (`true && false` — eval evaluates it lazily; the
    spine lowers only strict PrimOps, and `&&`/`||`/`|>` need control flow the lowerer does
    not yet emit) — the next unrepresented form — and still refuses cleanly (exit 2). No
    pre-existing corpus file flipped. Harness: **25 match, 0 mismatch, 0 js-crash**, 114
    unsupported (244 files) — +1 match (the fixture), unsupported unchanged; the `int`
    rewrite perturbed no `int`-calling program (0 mismatch). SPEC untouched; no graded row
    moves (still partial). Next: **D1(x)** = short-circuit `&&`/`||` (lowered to a lazy
    `if`), then `|>` — still pre-effect.
  - **D1(x) — short-circuit `&&`/`||` compile (the frontier twin flips again) — DONE
    2026-06.** The value D1(ix)'s guardrail was holding. `&&` and `||` are now lowered —
    and crucially they are **LAZY** in the right operand (eval returns `false`/`true`
    without evaluating the right when the left decides it), so they are NOT strict
    PrimOps. `a && b` ≡ `if a then b else false`, `a || b` ≡ `if a then true else b`. The
    new IR computation `Cond` (a value-producing conditional) carries the left as an atom
    and each branch as a value-`IRExpr`; emitjs emits it as a **JS ternary**, itself
    short-circuit, so the right operand's spine (wrapped in an arrow-IIFE when it has its
    own `Let`s) runs only when control reaches that branch. Because `Cond` is an ordinary
    comp, a `&&` nested inside a function argument or another operand composes for free.
    The load-bearing test is laziness under a guard: `guard(n) = n != 0 && 100 / n > 9`
    compiles so the division sits **inside** the ternary's then-branch — `guard(0)` prints
    `false` with no div-by-zero, byte-identical to eval (eager ANF evaluation would have
    diverged). Green fixture `compile_shortcircuit_test.velve` (both/either, the divide
    guard at 0/5/20, a chained `a && b || c`, and a `&&`-value passed as an argument)
    compiles byte-identically across 9 lines. **A forecast corrected:** pipe `|>` was
    never a frontier — it desugars to a saturated `Call` upstream (`5 |> double` ≡
    `double(5)`) and has compiled since D1(i); verified. So the frontier twin
    `compile_frontier_test.velve` rolled to a **non-tail `if` as a value** (`let x = if …`
    — the lowerer handles `if` in tail position only; as a `let` RHS it reaches
    `normComp`'s default and refuses) — the next unrepresented form — still exit 2. No
    pre-existing corpus file flipped. Harness: **26 match, 0 mismatch, 0 js-crash**, 114
    unsupported (245 files) — +1 match (the fixture), unsupported unchanged. SPEC
    untouched; no graded row moves (still partial). Next: **D1(xi)** = non-tail `if`/`match`
    as a value (reusing `Cond`) — still pre-effect.
  - **D1(xi) — non-tail `if` as a value compiles (the frontier twin flips again) — DONE
    2026-06.** The value D1(x)'s guardrail was holding. An `if` whose value is CONSUMED —
    bound by `let`, nested in an arithmetic expression, written as a function argument, or
    chained as an else-if ladder — now lowers, reusing the `Cond` value-producing
    conditional `&&`/`||` introduced in D1(x): the cond normalizes to an atom, each branch
    to a value-`IRExpr` emitted as a ternary arm (IIFE-wrapped only when the branch has its
    own spine). This is the exact value-position mirror of the tail-position `if` `tail()`
    already lowered — a one-case addition to `normComp` (a branchless `if` yields Unit, as
    in `tail`). Green fixture `compile_ifvalue_test.velve` (if-value by `let`, nested in
    `1 + (if …)`, as an `abs2(if …)` argument, and a three-way `grade` else-if chain)
    compiles **byte-identically** to eval (`10 / 6 / 7 / A / B / C`). The frontier twin
    `compile_frontier_test.velve` rolled to a **non-tail `match` as a value** (`let s = match
    …` — the lowerer compiles `match` in tail position only; as a `let` RHS it reaches
    `normComp`'s default) — the next unrepresented form — still exit 2. No pre-existing
    corpus file flipped. Harness: **27 match, 0 mismatch, 0 js-crash**, 114 unsupported (246
    files) — +1 match (the fixture), unsupported unchanged. SPEC untouched; no graded row
    moves (still partial). Next: **D1(xii)** = non-tail `match` as a value (reify the
    decision-spine as an IIFE) — still pre-effect.
  - **D1(xii) — non-tail `match` as a value compiles (the frontier twin flips again) — DONE
    2026-06.** The value D1(xi)'s guardrail was holding. A `match` whose value is consumed
    (bound by `let`, or a def body, or feeding an expression) now lowers: `matchE` already
    builds the `If`/`Let`/`Fail` decision-spine, and in value position that whole spine is
    reified by a new `Block` comp — emitjs wraps it in an arrow-IIFE returning the taken
    arm's value (the n-way generalization of what `Cond` does for one binary branch). A
    `Block` is an ordinary comp, so a value-`match` composes wherever a value is wanted. A
    one-case addition to `normComp` plus the `Block` comp and its one-line emitter (reusing
    the `exprValue` IIFE helper). Green fixture `compile_matchvalue_test.velve` (a scalar
    `match`-value by `let`, a ctor `match` binding its payload, a mid-def `let a = match …`,
    and a `match`-value reaching arithmetic via a def) compiles **byte-identically** to eval
    (`many / 300 / 16 / round / 37`). (Velve `match` arms are block-form, so a value `match`
    sits as a `let` RHS or def body, not inline inside a larger expression — a parse limit,
    not a compiler one.) The frontier twin `compile_frontier_test.velve` rolled to a
    **multi-clause `def`** (`fib(0)`/`fib(1)`/`fib(n)` — eval dispatches across clauses, the
    lowerer emits one JS `function` per `def` and refuses >1 clause) — the next unrepresented
    form — still exit 2. (String interpolation `"{x}"` was also confirmed never a frontier —
    it desugars to `++` concat upstream and has compiled since D1(i), like `|>`.) No
    pre-existing corpus file flipped. Harness: **28 match, 0 mismatch, 0 js-crash**, 114
    unsupported (247 files) — +1 match (the fixture), unsupported unchanged. SPEC untouched;
    no graded row moves (still partial). Next: **D1(xiii)** = multi-clause `def`s (clause
    dispatch as a `match` on the parameter tuple) — still pre-effect.
- **D2. Effects & concurrency runtime** *(5–10)*. Sagas (compile to state
  machines or generators — generators are the natural JS target),
  `go`/`race`/`after` on a scheduler, streams + backpressure policies,
  machines, stores/messages, virtual time (`sleep` semantics must match
  eval exactly or differential testing drowns in noise).
- **D3. Reactive UI** *(5–10)*. The element DSL → DOM render path compiled;
  the reconciler (which Animation's presence work needs hooks into — design
  them now, see E3); keyed-list virtualization (UI row's perf substrate).
- **D4. Frame substrate** *(2–3)*. `frames` clock, `@interaction`, the
  60fps loop — the things Games/Animation name explicitly.

**Exit:** Games C+ → **A−/A** (its row: "compiled backend + frame clock +
`@interaction`"), Animation's substrate gate lifts, UI virtualization
unblocks. Honest unknown: D2 is the widest variance — sagas/streams
semantics are the subtlest part of eval.ts.

## 6. Phase E — breadth tails (~25–35 slices, roughest estimates)

Parity work; almost none of it needs novel design. Sequenced after/with D
because chunks are blocked on it.

- **E1. UI table-stakes** *(~10–14)*: real Grid (tracks/areas/template,
  1–2); positioning/z-index/overflow/clip (1–2); aspect-ratio/object-fit
  (1); forms ecosystem — input types, validation wiring, controlled
  patterns (2–3); typography/i18n — truncation, rich text, RTL, font
  loading (2–3); media — srcset/lazy/icons (1–2); nested/scoped themes +
  per-component overrides (1–2). Each is a normal slice (fixture + `_bad` +
  render assertions). Virtualization lands in D3.
- **E2. Inputmap residuals** *(~3)*: std `Key` device library +
  physical-key prefix (needs a host keyboard source — D3 territory);
  focus-zone scoping; the rendered help-overlay element (its data layer,
  `help(map)`, already ships — this is the pixel side, needs the render
  path).
- **E3. Animation choreography** *(~9–12, design-first)*: (i) a
  choreography design note — presence/exit (reconciler must defer unmount),
  FLIP/shared-element (needs geometry read-back, currently excluded),
  timeline/stagger orchestration, gesture-coupled springs with velocity
  handoff — this is the one genuinely UNDESIGNED area left (1–2 doc
  slices); then presence (2), timeline/stagger (2), gesture coupling (2),
  FLIP (2–3). Ceiling per §8: row reaches **A**; A+ deliberately not
  chased.
- **E4. Canvas S2–S5** *(2–4)*: font metrics, alpha/gradient compositing,
  dynamic-text bounds, MaxSMT placement repair — the deferred legibility
  stages.

## 7. Dependency graph

```
A1 binder seeding ──→ C2 is-Ok narrowing
A3 measure facts ──→ binary-search showcase (same slice)
B1 design note ──→ B2 units ──→ std/units (shipped as C1(v))
B1 design note ──→ B3 sized types ──→ overflow (7/7)
B3 IR width tag ──→ D0/D1 IR design honors it
C1 imports ──→ std/ distribution of every library
D0 IR ──→ D1 ──→ D2 ──→ D3 ──→ D4
D3 render path ──→ E2 overlay/Key, E1 virtualization already in D3
D3 reconciler hooks ──→ E3 presence/FLIP
D4 frames ──→ Games re-grade, E3 anything timed
```

Phases A–C are strictly serializable at the slice cadence with zero blocking
on D. D can start (D0, the doc revision) any time after B1 settles the IR
questions.

## 8. Totals & expected grade movement

| Phase | Size | Grade movement |
|---|---|---|
| A proof arc | ~6 slices | Type-core A+ deepens; 6/7 obligations |
| B numerics | ~6 slices | Low-level B− → A−; 7/7 obligations |
| C infra | ~4 slices | (enables; no row moves) |
| D backend | ~20–30 | Games C+ → A−/A; Animation gate lifts |
| E breadth | ~25–35 | UI A → A+ trajectory; Event/state A → A+; Animation → A |

Designed board (A+B+C): **~16 slices**. Everything: **~60–80**. The honest
near milestone is end-of-C: a complete, internally consistent,
fully-graded *design* with every named gap closed or explicitly priced —
the backend and breadth are then build phases, not open questions.

## 9. Open questions for review

1. **Unit syntax** (B1): refinement-flavored `Number unit m/s` vs F# angle
   brackets vs a `where`-clause spelling — weigh grammar-impact (tree-sitter
   regen risk) against readability.
2. **Units and type inference**: annotation-only (units never inferred onto
   unannotated defs) is the conservative v1 — is full unit polymorphism
   (`def double(x: Number unit u): Number unit u`) worth it, given user
   generics already exist?
3. **Per-block `@proof[...]{}`** (A4): keep or cut? The module scope has
   covered every fixture; per-def brackets may be enough forever.
4. **IR shape** (D0): ANF vs CPS-for-sagas vs generators-as-primitive.
   **ANSWERED 2026-06 (D0, compiler-architecture-design §11.2): ANF**, effects as
   one explicit `Perform` node, **generators are a JS-emitter realization of
   `Perform`, not an IR primitive** — exactly the "fine at the emitter level, not
   the IR level" reading. CPS rejected (a native/LLVM backend would have to undo it).
5. **Differential-testing harness** (D1): three-column baseline (check /
   eval / compiled) vs golden-output files per fixture.
6. **Import syntax** (C1): SPEC §14's sketch vs module-path-as-string;
   how `@private` and `proofs:` interact across files (a proved module
   imported into an unproved one keeps its guarantees — state this).
7. **`Key` host source** (E2): browser-only (DOM events via D3) or also a
   terminal source for the CLI runtime?

## 10. Exit criteria

- **Phase A done** = binary-search fixture green under
  `proofs: [bounds, total]`-equivalent + gate-spelling fixture green +
  `arith` in the checkable list + sortBy divergence closed. **All four met
  (2026-06)** — `proof_binsearch_test`, `index_gate_test`, `proof_arith_test`,
  `sortby_test`. The A1 `let`-direct tail-position follow-on also shipped
  (`index_let_test`/`_bad`). What remains in-arc is optional/deferred: A4
  (finer proof scopes, possibly cut).
- **Phase B done** ✅ (2026-06) = `proofs: [overflow]` fixture green with a Z3
  model in the `_bad` (`proof_overflow_test`/`_bad`); `ms*ms → Duration²` pin
  green; Low-level row re-graded with the fixture named. B2(iii) general
  `std/units` shipped after Phase C imports as C1(v) (`units_lib_test`).
- **Phase C done** = `std/refined` imported (not included) by a green
  fixture; corpus baselines hold through the registry refactor.
- **Phase D done** = every corpus fixture's compiled output ≡ eval output;
  a 60fps fixture exists and holds frame budget in a real browser.
- **Phase E done** = the named lists in E1–E4 each have a green fixture or
  an explicit cut recorded in this file.
